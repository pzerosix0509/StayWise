Hội An,A Bống Villa,Traveloka,Thanh Xuan,"2,0",20/09/2024,Một kỳ nghỉ nhớ đời
Hội An,ABA Travel Villa,Traveloka,Dung Nguyen,"8,0",27/06/2025,"Phòng sạch sẽ, giá tốt, phòng mình ở có ban công thoáng tuy nhiên chắc gần bên cạnh là hàng ăn nên phòng có 1-2 con ruồi bay vào, vị trí cách phố cổ tầm 1,4 km. Nhà mình nhận phòng mới biết phòng ko có tủ lạnh và tối đi chơi về muộn tắm không có nước nóng, chắc bị lỗi j đó hoặc đúng hôm hết nước nóng. Nói chung gia đình nào có ý định dừng nghỉ tại hội an chủ yếu đi chơi ko phải kiểu nghỉ dưỡng thì đây cũng là một lựa chọn phù hợp và giá cả phải chăng."
Hội An,ABA Travel Villa,Traveloka,CUONG VO HUNG,"10,0",13/05/2025,"Phòng đẹp, rộng, thoáng, sạch sẽ. Có chỗ để xe ô tô, đi bộ 10p tới phố cổ. Xung quanh nhiều hàng quán ăn uống."

Hội An,Ahoy Hoi An Boutique Resort & Spa,Traveloka,Camilla,"10,0",22/07/2025,"Utrolig trivelig hotell og personale. Bassengområdene er helt topp. Hotellet er trukket tilbake i fra hoved veien så det er veldig fredelig område. Når en tar prisen på overnatting her mot selve opplevelsen så gir dette veldig mye overnatting for pengene. Personalet er også fantastiske og gjør det hele til en veldig god opplevelse. Kan absolutt anbefale å bo her. Frokosten er helt ok, men restauranten ut over det var ikke noe bra. Vær obs på at hotellet krever ekstra betaling for ekstraseng og frokost til barn her, ut over det som er betalt via hotells.com"

Hội An,Aira Boutique Hoi An Hotel & Villa,GoogleMap,Brian,"6,0",09/04/2023,"For how much you are paying compared to other places close by, the communication from the front desk regarding a tour i booked through them could have been better. The laundry service i was told would be ready by 5pm then it changed to 8pm after i had already given them my laundry. It was a good stay and it was great having a pool and access to the beach. The rooms and showers were large and comfortable. Overall a great stay with a few disappointing parts of the service."
Hội An,Aira Boutique Hoi An Hotel & Villa,Traveloka,Stefanie,"8,0",07/05/2024,"The property is in a fantastic location. We walked to an bang beach each day and loved all the restaurants nearby. Our room was a great size, beds and pillows were very comfortable. Loved the loaner beach baskets. Onsite buffet is delicious. We didn t love the pools and pool surroundings. The main pool with swim up bar was fine, but definitely not something to write home about. The secondary pool area felt rundown and needed a fresh coat of paint and some clean up. The hotel is split into two separate buildings with a few homes dividing it, which was a bit strange and there is construction you walk past to get from the 2nd building to the main building. Overall, it is a nice resort and the staff is excellent. The location is perfect and while i was disappointed in the pool, the beach proximity was fantastic and that was where we spent the majority of our days. I recommend staying here and if i go back to hoi an, i would stay here again."

The hotel is a minute walk to an bang beach, and about a 10 min ride to the old district of hoi an. It is much quieter by the beach (city centre could get a bit touristy) and staying here was the right decision. Staying at this hotel has been the highlight of our vietnam trip!"

We had lunch and dinner at restaurant and found better quality elsewhere. So would only go there for breakfast. One negative mention when we were there jan/feb 2024 there was construction next door. Looked like another plot was being prepared for additional building. Did not bother us, but construction was typically 6.30 in the morning to 7.00 in the evening."

I did not try the pool bar the pools themselves felt a bit too cozy for me and i opted to spend more time at the beach. I must have misunderstood that they had a beach space, but in fact the only beach chairs and umbrellas are owned by beachside restaurants. You can use them with any purchase, though honestly i did not see that enforced at all. I had an attic room that stayed a bit warm, but was a really nice space complete with a balcony. They did offer a to-go breakfast when i left because it was so early, but it really wasn t appetizing. Overall, very good experience."

We were there in early november, off season, so not much swimming was done in the ocean. There s also an erosion problem, on the beach, so there s a wall of huge sandbags. The hotel staff was very accommodating to our needs and even provided me with a birthday cake, on my special day. The hotel led a free two hour bike tour. The bikes were in great shape and could be checked out at any time for a ride. The hotel did provide a free shuttle to ancient town, hoi an.

There are a few decent restaurants nearby, notably the old man which is next door and family run serving superb food and 200 metres in the opposite direction, chine in our view, the downsides were the location, it was quite a way from town, subsequently very little to do in the evenings, and the beach was very narrow due to sand-bags which looked like giant sausages which ran along the entire stretch of beach to stop the sea washing it away. The pool area at the hotel is very restricted and the place cries out for a decent bar where guests can socialise."

The hotel is located across the road from the beach, and their beach side restaurant is across the road and a little way down. The staff were friendly, professional and helpful and the hotel offered complimentary tours, shuttle bus to town, and bicycles. Our room was spacious, modern and clean, with a lovely view of the ocean from the balcony. Although the bed had two single mattresses pushed together under a mattress protector, we didn t find this to be a major problem. Wifi in the room and around the resort was good. The private beach wasn t particularly large or clean, however there are some lovely stretches of beach just a short walk away. We found that the food served at the breakfasts and at the restaurant was nothing particularly special, although still up to standard. Overall, our experience at the hotel was very good and we would consider returning."

Hội An,Ally Beach Boutique Hotel Hoi An,GoogleMap,Michael,"6,0",26/05/2024,"Nice little beach hotel. Not a lot to do in the area but it s relaxing. Had a good stay for the most part and extended our stay for an additional 4 nights but had a few issues during our stay 1- air conditioning was weak , it got cool but never cold even on the lowest setting and having them come check on it 2 times they never fixed it. 2- walls are thin and hallways echo with noisy staff or guests. For the most part, we had a pretty quiet trip minus housekeeping, being loud in the mornings, talking to each other at a higher volume than necessary and our last night a large chinese group checking in and waking up at 5 am and being extremely loud yelling at each other from 5 am to 9 am so could not sleep. 3- be careful as they have glass bottles for shower gel and shampoo with a very small shelf in the shower area i got charged 200,000 dong because of their poor design. The bottles fell off the small shelf and broke in the shower and almost cut my girlfriend s feet. Management should re-look at the design of shower and shampoo dispensers in the shower to protect their guest. Otherwise they could have a lawsuit from an injury. 4- the maintenance crew on one morning decided to start hammer drilling into the foundation right outside our door at 8 30 am. I was not happy by any means to be woken up that way after sternly talking to them that we were sleeping they stopped. Besides those issues, it was a comfortable stay and relaxing time the front desk staff were very friendly."

Hotel is not every big and rooms were quite plain jane. One recommendation is to upgrade the tv s and to have hd channels. Beach is actually not connected to the hotel so you ll have to take a 2-3 minute walk to get to the beach. Unfortunately we arrived while there was a storm so did not even get to enjoy the beach at all. Breakfast was decent and staff would help get what you need if not already available. Hotel is about 5km away from old town. Bikes are available from the hotel free of charge and we rode in one day. Trip was fairly easy as it s pretty much flat road. Would definitely recommend doing this to explore the town. Overall a good trip and great stay at this hotel. Would definitely come back!

Ruby at the front desk was a great help, spoke very good english, and an and wing in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. There was some issues with food consistency though (often bland or too salty, overcooked bacon, then new batch came out awhile later undercooked). A little more attention to detail and consistency would go a long long way, and make a big difference. Water temp consistency in our shower kept going up and down, sometimes worse than others, and you would have to keep adjusting it back and forth. Hotel photos show and talk about a beautiful private beach, but unfortunately it was destroyed in a bad storm a year or more ago, but they never updated it online, and don t say anything when you check in. The beach restaurant we never tried, and is unfortunately nowhere near newer like the hotel, and not somewhere we wanted to try after viewing it. One good thing they do offer is a free shuttle to another beautiful beach 2.5 km away (an bang beach) which i would recommend checking out. Free shuttle also goes downtown nightly which was nice as we wanted to go check out the lantern festival. There is also tons and tons of shops to get custom clothing made in town, and different restaurants and little bars, and venders to check out. We spent three days here."

Hội An,Ally Beach Boutique Hotel Hoi An,GoogleMap,Jessie,"4,0",27/04/2019,"We were very disappointed with the location of this hotel. When traveling to hoi an it would be best to stay near the ancient town as the beach that alley is/was on was hit by a storm years ago apparently leaving there not much to been seen in their beach area. There are huge sandbags laying out on the coast. The view is still decent however the alley restaurant/ club along the water is not set up for patrons. They have chairs and a few beds to lay on but the beds are all dirty, the condition of the furniture does not allow for you to relax. They serve food and drink there but we went twice and both times only one other couple was there and again, due to the messy conditions it was not relaxing to stay. They have a shuttle to a private beach which we did not do because of the few shuttle times offered daily and it was not convenient for us. Although they had a nice breakfast spread i wasn t confident that everything was very clean and sanitary so i wouldn t rate it well. The vegetables looked a little dirty and in general mugs slightly dirty. The fried rice was like mush. Omelet was made okay one day and raw in the middle another day. Lastly, my husband woke up with some bites around his ankle. Not sure what kind of bites but it left a bad feeling. We ended up checking out a day early and going to another hotel. If you don t care about the location it would be a decent place to stay for the price but we would choose a different place next time."
Hội An,Ally Beach Boutique Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Eric,"4,0",27/04/2019,"The hotel is very well appointed, but with the beach being destroyed last january by the storm. You have to take the shuttle bus to go to the private beach . Just three or four shuttles a day to go to the beach or you have to take a cab. (about 10 mn drive). I thought i could use the beach as much as i wanted but to drive there make this hotel location pointless. I don t like the fact to organize my stay around the shuttle to the beach or to the city. Also my sea view was over many trees, gabages and 20 see view..."

So had to shuttle to a nearby beach. I didn t see any mention of this anywhere about the hotel. The ally beach resturant is also closed, but when i asked about it from one of the receptionist, he was trying to hide the fact that it s closed, and he was insisting that it closed for the day, only 10 min earlier than when i asked. I found that very rude and humiliating! because it was obvious that no one was there for a long time! there were no lights and none of fridges were working."

The hotel layout is beautiful with the gorgeous swimming pool surrounded by loungers and palm trees - even though it was busy at times, it was a great place to relax and have a swim after a day exploring hoi an (only 5-10 minutes walk away) in the heat. The staff were all incredibly helpful and hospitable too - special mentions must go to the classy zippy at reception who checked me in (and was very helpful in helping me access some money when stranded without either a card or cash), and my in the bar / restaurant for being so friendly and fun.

Hội An,Almanity Hoi An Resort & Spa,GoogleMap,KAITLIN,"10,0",16/08/2024,"The staff were generally friendly and welcoming at this hotel. There was a weird moment where we felt like we betrayed one of the receptionists for not going to the suit tailor the hotel recommends but apart from that they were nice. We stayed in one of the the loft rooms which was fine for us. Not recommended if you can t do stairs though. The loft design was cool but the room decor is a little outdated. The couch down stairs is possibly the most uncomfortable one i ve ever sat on and is not suitable for 2 people. The bathroom small but good enough. I like that they didn t give us plastic bottles. Instead there were 2 refillable bottles which were replaced at room service each day. The fridge and safe both worked well and the aircon was great. Pool was beautiful, with lots of seating and pool side service. We were told off for sipping drinks (kombucha) by the pool which was not purchased at the hotel. I thought that was annoying and poor form. Restaurant is luxury prices for not really luxurious food. Lastly, the walls are paper thin and we could hear neighbours from all angles, at all times of the day. I even woke up to the sounds of our next door neighbours getting down and dirty at 7am one morning. Don t stay here if you value your sleep, privacy or dignity. Overall it was a decent hotel but would probably try somewhere else next time."

The hotel as a whole is very pleasing, with almost everything you could wish to have. Beautiful and clean pools in the centre, a lot of greenery, their own herb garden and a nice outside area makes it very scenic. No complaints about the staff as the service was splendid. The breakfast was delicious, with an impressive selection of food and drinks. Eggs and phò was made to order, which is always appreciated. Good selection of fresh fruits and baked goods as well. Did not try the restaurant, but the pool-side serving was good. The room was spaceous, with good amenities. We appreciated the daily bottles of water, fruits and nuts. The interior had some wear and tear, with some malfunctioning lights, but nothing critical. Nice bathroom, but the shower and hot water was difficult to control and the water pressure was poor. Very good air conditioning, with almost no noise. The bed was firm, but nice. We had the rooftop balcony with jaquzzi, but did not use the latter (although it looked nice).

The room we stayed in (standard, one level) was poorly designed door to hallway lets in noise, a/c is constantly on and blows directly onto bed, weird creaky bed platform, and a glass enclosed toilet area with a door that does not provide privacy. Also, in addition to the instagram snap-happy people in the pool, you ll get some noisy tour group hordes. We stayed here 4 nights and expected better.

I asked them to show me the sheets all they would produce of pictures claiming that they were my sheets. At checkout i asked again about producing the sheets they claim i damage for which they again did not produce. Another customer was at the front desk claimed they did the same to them. It leads me to believe that this ruined sheet thing is a scam by the house keeping manager. I have nothing but good to say about the remaining staff. If you stay there take a picture of your sheets every morning before you leave the room so you get taken by the same scam. One word for everyone beware and document via photos every morning."

Ligger 5 min. I gåafstand fra den gamle by, så man også undgår den værste gadestøj. Kæmpe morgenmadsbuffet med både vestlige og vietnamesiske retter. Det eneste minus er, at væggene er en smule tynde, så hvis der er nogen, der larmer på gangen, kan man høre det ret tydeligt på værelserne. Vi oplevede det kun en enkelt aften."

We ate out every night as there are so many great restaurants in hoi an, so can t comment on the evening meals at the hotel, but the breakfasts were really good. We took advantage of some novel activities, like the short daily tai chi classes around the pool and a one-on-one vietnamese language session from the lovely no . The very helpful binh provided lots of local knowledge and secured us a 10 discount at the best local tailors tuong tailor .

Unfortunately, during our stay, we faced an unexpected challenge as both of us fell ill and were hospitalized for two days. However, it was during this time of need that the true character of the hotel staff shone brightly. They not only provided us with excellent medical support but also went above and beyond by personally delivering food and checking in on us multiple times throughout our hospitalization. Their genuine care and concern made a difficult situation much more manageable, and we are forever grateful for their kindness. Beyond the outstanding service, the hotel itself was a haven of comfort and tranquility. The facilities were immaculate, the location central and convenient, and every aspect of our stay was flawlessly executed.

It was not what we were expecting we had planned to stay at resorts. Now knowing what the place is like we would definitely consider staying on out next trip

Donc il prenne la réservation et l argent même complet et après dispatche les clients en prenant une commission bien entendu. Je suis pas satisfait et surtout c est vraiment pas sérieux"
Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",24/01/2018,"First of all, i can highly recommend this place for kind, helpful and very sweet staff. People were so willing to give a hand, offer advice...and from a very genuine place. Questions and issues were swiftly addressed both by email and in person. The house itself was fantastic- very cozy with a kitchen where we could easily cook (or have cooking done for us). It was so nice for a family and very reasonably priced. The heart-breaker was the construction going on everywhere in an bang, including right next door. The whole village is being bought up by wealthier outsiders and being built up (although supposedly no mega hotels). The beach may have been a stunner at one time and still does have its charms, but the garbage was horrendous. However, we did take this opportunity to teach our child to pick up trash. We would certainly go again because the village people are sweet, the food is excellent, and it is not as bad as near-by areas, like hoi an and danang. Overall, the rapid development of this area and lack of environmental protection is ruining it."

Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,Traveloka,Trise,"10,0",08/03/2017,"This home stay is very difficult to find. There is a black sign with white writing pointing to it on the main road, but on the sign it is called an bang retreat. That is your only clue. There are two rooms on the second floor that have wonderful balconies overlooking green papaya trees and palms, etc. The ground floor rooms are not very private to my standards. But everyone staying there is friendly so it may not matter. The staff, especially hang the manager, are quite wonderful. The bed was great. There are sections of anbang beach that are dirty and eroded, but here the beach is lovely. We enjoyed our stay here quite a lot."

Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,Traveloka,Adam,"10,0",23/02/2017,"Very close to beach, rooms are spacious, elegant if fairly simple in terms of facilities. It s a 15 minute bike ride into town (hoi an), which is good for clothes shopping and a variety of good restaurants. Centre of hoi an is interesting but a bit overfull of tourists. Beach at an bang is nice, fairly quiet, but this was winter season so not really swimming weather. It rains a fair amount this time of year. Staff (in particular my who speaks good english) are keen to help you out with whatever you need. A good spot if you re looking for quiet and relaxation by the sea."

Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"6,0",30/12/2016,"We stayed at an bang hideaway in mid dec-knowing it was rainy season-so i want to make sure this review is read with that in mind.the place it self is very cute and has a lot of potential,nice facility and a good short walk to the beach,big room ok bed.if the weather was better i think this would be a great beach destination.with that said,i also want to say that i hope the staff and service was also on off season.in our 4 days there,we arrived to a pitch black property (we got there at 5 30 pm)with only a note,and the security guard to help us- who spoke no english.that was all fine, as we read the note the staff is off duty at 5pm,but after only an hour there the whole place lost power.we would have believed it was due to the weather,but it was a clear day and every other place on the street still had lights.the power was off and on all 4 days, never really consistent,and the only excuse being rain(even though it didn t actually rain a lot of the time).whatever, we made due but it was disappointing.i ll go further to say that although the girl working there was very sweet,i hope they have more help during the high season as we felt pretty abandoned there after 5 pm when she left.my biggest issue was that even though short staffed, they could have at least cleaned the room daily-which they did not.not even giving new towels or toilet paper or emptying the trash.this place had great potential- just come in high season, they should just shut it down in winter."
Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,Traveloka,Nikolaos,"10,0",21/11/2016,"We enjoyed the stay a lot. Although there was a misunderstanding of plans initially, the lady in charge was very prompt to compensate the situation, and got us upgraded to a better villa (coco villa), right next door. It happened that our daughter had her birthday that day, and they were kind enough to surprise us with a birthday cake. They need to add signs from the main road though, since it is difficult to orient yourself in the small village without public lighting."
Hội An,An Bang Beach Hideaway Homestay,GoogleMap,Adam,"8,0",31/08/2016,Despite some hiccups regarding power cuts and thus the lack of air conditioning the construction work going on around the homestay we enjoyed our stay and greatly appreciated the service - lovely accommodating people!

The way we travel, we normally grab ideas through online research and see where the day takes us and the amount of recommendations that diem clearly curated over long months of research truly showed we were not disappointed in any of the spots she led us to. Everyone within the family was responsive to our needs and requests via whataspp. Somehow we found ourselves feeling both like royalty and family during our stay and i couldn t recommend this homestay more. Also note that it is clear the an bang area has seen an increase in tourism as many of the streets have in-progress infrastructure upgrades. I d be very excited and curious to know how the town looks in just a few years. We hope to come back very soon!"

Hội An,An Bang Beach Pool Villa,Traveloka,Thanh-Ha,"8,0",22/09/2018,"The villa location is almost next by the beach which takes you 2 mins to walk to the beach. The room we had on 2nd floor has a big bathroom which has 1 indoor shower and 1 outdoor shower. I like that the place has pretty comfy bed and almost every room got it own balcony. Just a highlight that the villa is almost in the end of crowded an bang beach, so either morning and afternoon, the beach is perfect location for anyone who likes a quiet beach to chill, not so crowded nor dirty. Bikes are free for guest but we rarely used it since it s nicer to walk around a small little village."

The beach is not as crowded compare to other beaches in da nang/hoi an. The staff members are helpful and polite. One thing to be improved is the management. Upon arrival, we were told that there were only 2 rooms available and we have booked 3 rooms. Another thing is the cleanliness. We were given extra bed and duvet but the duvet provided smelt a bit funny and the towel provided were sometimes not as hygienic as one would expect. Having said the above, it definitely worth the price, the swimming pool within the villa is nice and clean, the complimentary breakfast is good, you can borrow the bikes for free and it was only a 30 min bike ride to the ancient town."

Lana was great and helped me with my day trip to hue. Lloyd ( sorry if i got your name wrong, you know who you are buddy) helped me with and amazing day riding the hai van pass. The girls in the kitchen who no matter how late i woke up due to my ongoing jet lag ( or too many beers ) would always offer me breakfast. As a solo traveller i often feel overlooked or ever ignored at times in some of the bigger places i stay. At gold coast they were so nice, always asking how i was, what i was up too and genuinely interested in looking after their guests. I hope i will be back soon and if i do this is where i want to stay, you are doing a great job guys so please don t lose your personal touch. Thank you, david."

Felt like i made new friends here at the villa. Location near to the beach. Laneway access to villas not a problem. Friendly local neighbours. You feel a little part of the local community tucked away just behind the beach. Easy walk along the beach to an bangs main beachside cafes. Would recommend the villa to friends.

The rooms were comfortable and clean, the pool was welcoming, and the tropical garden was beautiful. There was a good mix of guests. It is a 10 minutes taxi ride to the historic town, a 10 minutes bike ride to the beach, and next to the rice fields. They have rental bikes and motorbikes which is convenient. Phuong was amazing she gave us tips about how to navigate the city, arrange taxi pick ups from the hotel, and ask the kitchen to make a bun cha for diner one night. The owners were extremely nice and caring. As i was sick, they gave me medications and one of the owner even made me a local remedy - which helped a lot. We highly recommend an villa!"

From the very beginning the hotel staff go out of your way to make you feel at home, the rooms were gorgeous with such nice touches and the food was incredible there. Also the quiet location was perfect - away from the hustle bustle of the town - but the (electric) bikes they rent made everything so accessible."

Hội An,An Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,THU TRAM,"10,0",29/10/2018,We chose this place because it was a quiet boutique hotel by a river in the countryside. And everything exceeded our expectations as it was a homestay but it gave us a feeling of staying at a resort. The staff was friendly and very helpful. One of them even let us borrow her bike for a couple of hours. It was really good value for money. We rate everything 5 stars except the local area because of the super loud karaoke in the neighborhood but this had nothing to do with the hotel.

Rather better to stay here than in one of the new, huge hotels that dominate the coast from da nang south to hoi an with shuttle buses etc etc. The road into town has undergone a facelift recently with some nice restaurants, bars and massage shops.

Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",21/09/2019,"룸, 조경, 인테리어 등 전체적인 디자인이 세련되고 직원들이 친절합니다. 수영장은 작지만 나무그늘이 있어 더울때 놀기 좋고, 룸 앞의 작은 테라스는 정원을 마주보고 있어 앉아만 있어도 좋습니다. 올드타운도 걸어서 7 8분 정도로 생각보다 가깝고, 조식 메뉴 또한 다양하진 않아도 고급스러운 건강식입니다. (수제잼, 건강쥬스 등) 요가 클래스도 꽤 전문적으로 진행되는 것 같습니다. 다만, 전반적으로 관광보다는 휴양을 목적으로 방문하기에 좋은 호텔 같습니다. 수영장에서조차 책을 읽는 분위기이며, 룸이 외부 복도와 바로 연결되고 바닥이 대리석이라 방음이 안됩니다. 시설 단점으로는 욕실 샤워실이 좁아서 물이 바닥으로 튀고, 2층 건물이지만 엘리베이터가 없으며, 오래된 리조트 건물이라 비올땐 지린내 같은 냄새가 살짝 납니다. 쓰는 김에, 호텔 정문 맞은편 골목의 로컬 식당을 강력 추천합니다. 세탁소와 옷 판매를 겸한 테이블 2개 정도의 작은 가게인데 모든 메뉴가 너무너무 맛나요! 특히 쌀국수ㅠ (구글에선 가게명이 the heart 라고 나오는데 확실치 않음)"

Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Henrik L.,"8,0",06/05/2019,"Skønt hotel i udkanten af hoi an, helt ideelt for familien. 10 min. Gang til det historiske centrum, og blot 15-20 mins. Cykkelafstand til den lækreste sandstrand. Hotellet stiller gratis cykler til rådighed, hvis man har mod på at vove sig ud i trafikken i vietnam. Ellers er det enkelt at få en taxa fra hotellet, hvilket koster ca. Kr. 20-30. Hotellet er i generel fin stand, og service fra det meget venlige personale er høj. Værelserne er store og rumlige, indrettet i hyggelig lokal stil. Rengøringen var ligeledes helt i top. Både på værelse, samt de øvrige omgivelser. Wifi dækning var god på hele hotellets område. Vi bookede inklusive morgenmadsbuffet, som absolut levede op til forventning, med et varieret udvalg fra både det internationale og lokale køkken. Herunder frisktlavede æg, omeletter, etc. Poolområdet var en smule skuffende. Poolen er meget lavvandet (vel 1 m.), og området med liggestole fyldes hurtigt op. Servering og service omkring poolen, var ej heller på helt samme niveau som det øvrige hotelområde. Priserne på anantara s bar og restaurant, samt udflugter arrangeret af hotellet er skyhøj, i sammenligning med udbudet i området (2-3 gange så høj). Spiller dog en mindre rolle, da udbuddet af restauranter i gå-afstand er særdeles omfattende, og meget varierende."

Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"10,0",29/08/2019,"We had a lovely few days here. The staff are wonderfully kind and patient. The rooms are pleasingly designed with a calm, tranquil feel. We switched rooms to an upper level river view after one night as there was a lot of footfall outside our original ground level room as it was by the pool area. The upper level room was calm and peaceful. Each riverview room has a little sitting area/patio with a ceiling fan that makes for a really relaxing nook. On our last night we arrived home late and tired after a busy day exploring hoi an and when we got into bed we were surprised to find rather a lot of sand inside the sheets! it made for a very uncomfortable night of sleep and when we spoke to the management about this the next day they refunded us the payment for the night. It was very well-handled by the management team, as this isn t the level of comfort that they aspire to provide, or that one would expect from an anantara property. The breakfast buffet is worth calling out especially, as it s small but perfectly formed and utterly delicious. After we left the property we realised we had forgotten an errand at a shop just across the street, and the hotel staff were extremely kind in helping us complete the errand, even though we had already checked out. We were blown away by their kindness and helpfulness - true vietnamese hospitality. All in all a wonderful stay, and probably the best place to stay in hoi an."

The breakfast provided was wonderful with an excellent selection. Staff were friendly and very attentive. The room was lovely and spacious. The pool was beautiful and clean. The only criticism i have is the price of drinks at the hotel restaurant. A glass of wine was 18(aus) for a 40 bottle of nz wine and the beer was also expensive compared to other hotels we have stayed at. The restaurant and bars were very quiet at the hotel. The night we ate there we were the only guests. I assume that other guests would have also found they were much better off eating outside the hotel. The laundry fees were also very expensive at 5 times the cost of the local laundry s just outside the hotel gates who washed and pressed our laundry professionally and returned within 24 hours."

A few disappointments, we asked for a late check out and it was extended until 2pm, but we would be charged usd100 if we wanted it until 5pm. This was a monday and we could clearly see, in the pool, in unused rooms and in the dining areas, that the hotel was practically empty, it would have cost the hotel nothing, but it would have been a simple and easy way to excel in customer service and consideration. I felt that the staff were following a rule and would not alter. We were offered a late check out until 5pm if we arranged for a car to da nang airport through the hotel, but again, this was over usd100! we caught a taxi, large and air conditioned for usd25. The prices are not comparable. Also, we ate in the riverside cafe, it is a superb location and the staff were very good. But the cost of the meal for two people was extortionate, especially the wine. The food was okay, but it didn t justify a bill of usd150!!! we didn t spend a third of that in the great restaurants in hoi an, where the food was actually better.

Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,richard,"10,0",26/04/2019,Great hotel...an oasis near the busy old town.
Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",29/04/2019,"Very well located, comfortable hotel which combined modern comfort with traditional charm. Helpful, friendly staff. Only bad point was the buffet dinner in the riverside restaurant - very poor selection, poor quality food and greatly overpriced (very poor value for money).breakfast and a la carte lunch was fine."
Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,JJ,"4,0",20/03/2019,"The staff are mostly lovely, the property beautiful. The rooms have great porches for sitting outside. Hoi an is utterly charming. But three things marred our visit. There is no soundproofing between rooms. You hear every chair moved in the room above you, even light switches being flipped in the room next to you. At the front desk we tried to exchange a hundred-dollar bill, as we were out of cash. The staff refused because the bill had a tiny blue mark on it, and they said the bank would not accept it. (fortunately, when we marched over to the bank, this turned out to be untrue.) third, an overly zealous cleaner threw out my invisiline retainers. True, they are clear, but they are not really hard to miss. Now i am stuck without them for two months of travel."
Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Perry,"10,0",01/05/2019,"The best hotel experience i have had in years, the staff could not have possibly been more accomdating to ensure our stay was as memorable as possible.

Hội An,Anantara Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Hannah,"8,0",13/10/2018,"Lovely hotel overall. Pool was peaceful and great to cool down, not huge but perfect for what we needed. They are doing some refurbishments and some where located near our room so could hear that throughout they say. We also took a trip to my son ancient city with the hotel, thoroughly enjoyed it however it was quite pricey. The hotel transfers as well were very expensive. Good location you can walk into the old quarter easily."

Our towels very more clammy and moist when we left than when we arrived. Room was ok clean - but moldy. Breakfast incl is one small dish/pers (ie 1 egg w/bread or 1 youghurt w/fruit or 1 pancake) only and 1 small drink. Everything else is extra. We didn t get the homestay/family feel here at all - conversation was at a minimum. The least interested/welcoming stay we have had in 5 weeks. Owner was helpful w trip to hué but expect 3-4 hrs drive each way as speedlimit is 60km/hr so not possible to combine ba na hills and hué in one day as we planned w owner. Travelling w/ kids we were disappointed pool was not cleaned/ready for use. Also no barrier around pool so be careful if u stay with children. Laundry service was excellent!"

The home is both beautiful and in a convenient location - a quiet, quaint, and friendly neighborhood but not far from the old town and famous tourist sites. Anh and the family took exceptional care of us! they made delicious breakfast to order each morning, gave us many tips for our itinerary and had both bicycles and motorbikes on site for us to rent. Our family of 4 loved our stay. Beds were exceptionally comfortable, rooms clean, and the pool was refreshing to enjoy after a day of exploring. They also arranged a driver to take us to da nang to our next hotel that was cheaper than a grab car or any other options we could find."

The hotel is spotless, the beds incredibly comfortable, and the pool perfectly chilled, offered the ideal escape from the heat of vietnam. Breakfast was a daily highlight fresh, delicious, and with a wide variety to suit every taste. The location strikes a great balance peacefully tucked away from the hustle of hoi an s centre, yet still within easy walking distance to the heart of town. But what truly sets anio apart is the people. The staff were warm, welcoming, and genuinely attentive, going above and beyond to make our stay seamless and memorable. From the moment we arrived to the moment they waved us off in our taxi, we felt completely cared for. Special thanks to flora, ms hue, ms van, mr dolphin, and mr ken you turned a great stay into a special memory. I wouldn t hesitate to return to anio, and next time, i ll be staying even longer."

They have a free shuttle into the old town or to the beach. When we decided to take a grab to the old town instead it was under 2. Because it s not right in the old town it was nice and quiet.

God service vi satte pris på var venlige og smilende personaler mulighed for at låne cykler gratis selvom de godt kunne trænge til lidt bedre gear. -) en gratis behandling (massage), som var meget god. Fint udbud af morgenmad. Gode store værelser. Mulighed for shuttle bus til byen. Der var meget lydt, og det var generende at der sent om aftenen/natten var meget gøende hunde. Rengøringen vækkede os et par morgener lidt over kl.08 for at ville gøre rent. Det kunne godt være efter kl.10 der var alt for få liggestole og vi kunne desværre ikke ligge og sole os, da alt var optaget. Men alt i alt. Et skønt ophold."
Hội An,Anio Boutique Hotel Hoi An,GoogleMap,Mark,"8,0",14/03/2024,"Staff were amazing at this property. Very helpful, friendly and eager to ensure you were taken care of. From check in we had a thorough introduction to the local area and recommendations for places to visit. Very useful was a transfer service to the main town area which is otherwise a 20 minute walk or a roughly 50k vnd taxi. Sadly a few things about the property we didn t like. Firstly it didn t appear well sound insulated. You could hear the maid trolleys in the corridor. And secondly, the shower setup was not ideal. The shower was a rain head above the bath in its own cubicle. However with steps up to the bath and nothings to stop the water from splashing onto the steps you had to be very careful getting in and out. If you re slightly infirm i would take a look at the room pictures and make an informed choice. However the rest of the amenities in the room were very good. Particularly the air conditioning which was excellent and when used with the ceiling fan it kept the room nicely cool. Overall i would recommend this hotel and consider staying again."

Hội An,Anio Boutique Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Thu,"6,0",31/07/2024,"We chose anio because we were sold on the stock pictures online however we were disappointed at arrival to find the property and room darker and more rundown in reality. The room was comfortable and furnished with all essential amenities. The service was good overall with friendly and attentive staff. The pool was nice and adequate while the included breakfast buffet was tasty had a good variety. Considering this was a more expensive option in comparison to other similar accommodations in hoi an, we would likely opt for a cheaper alternative that s closer to ancient town on our next visit."

Hội An,Anio Boutique Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Nigel,"10,0",23/01/2025,Fabulous hotel - stayed here 3 nights with grown up family. Great service throughout. Provided us with rooms very early after overnight train journey. Lovely spacious rooms. Breakfast probably the best we have had in a month of travelling. They provide a bus service ( every couple of hours which you need to book) to get into old town. However we walked or took taxi ( very cheap - grab bikes available but v few cars). Went out on hotel bikes - fine for a tip into town or out to paddy fields but no gears so not for serious cyclists overall great place - all family loved the hotel and hoi an - yes a bit too touristy but definitely worth a visit

Wasn t too happy with the breakfast the first 2 days when the buffet was closed (i guess because of low occupancy) but for the last day they when they were serving buffet aggain it was fine. We got upgraded and they did a honeymoon set up for us, which was highly appreciated. Overall a good stay and i would definitely consider staying there again if visiting hoi an."
Hội An,Anio Boutique Hotel Hoi An,GoogleMap,Kerry,"4,0",19/07/2022,"We booked pre covid expecting a relaxing holiday at a nice spa hotel but when we finally made it we were so disappointed. It was extremely noisy! children running up and down the hallway day and night people shouting at each other even though they are in the same room constant knocking on doors and shouting at family members and doors being left open setting off the alarms which were ignored! this would start any time between 5-6am and continued all day until 11-12pm. Pool areas were full of children running around screaming and shouting. Spa only provided massages (which were very good) but none of the other services were available (manicures, pedicures, facials etc) which we didn t find out until after we had booked in. We know of several people who booked out early and went elsewhere because of the noise. We would have done the same but we would have lost our credits and couldn t afford to go to another hotel. Also, we didn t know if the next hotel would have the same noise problem. The staff were lovely and tried their hardest to make things better but it was a lost cause."

From the moment of arrival, the staff could not have been more helpful. They are so genuine in their desire to ensure your stay goes as well as possible and everyone who worked there was a real credit to the hotel. The family room with 2 doubles was nice and spacious and the bathroom was big too. Breakfast was a real delight with 5 banks of food from pastries, fruit, asian cusine, western cuisine and an egg chef too. We ate at the restaurant too and can recommend the good quality and wide selection on the menu. Pool was also good, never too busy. Theres also a free bus service to and from hoi an and an bang beach. We used this a couple of times but it s a 40 dong taxi ride back so no issue if you dont want to stick to the timetable. All in all, we could not have been happier and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a base from which to discover hoi an and nearby areas."

They were always attentive, friendly, and eager to assist with any request. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, blending modern comfort with hoi an s charming aesthetic. My room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and well-equipped with everything i needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was incredibly cozy, and i loved waking up to a peaceful atmosphere each morning. The location close enough to explore the ancient town and nearby attractions, yet tucked away enough to provide a tranquil retreat. I also enjoyed the hotel s amenities, including the refreshing pool and delicious breakfast selection that featured both local and international options. Overall, my stay at anmira hotel exceeded my expectations. It s a perfect choice for anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay in hoi an.

We arranged a trip through the homestay and this was added to our bill at the end as was our driver to hue. We stayed for 3 nights but wished we could have stayed longer. I wouldn t hesitate in recommending azalea homestay."

Hội An,Azalea Homestay,GoogleMap,Aaron,"10,0",11/03/2018,"I stayed several places during my almost three weeks in hoi an and azalea homestay was the one that was in the nicest condition. No signs of age to the rooms or guest areas. The rooms are quite spacious, completely clean, well-kept, comfortable and with welcomed amenities. The bathroom is also spacious and set up nicely. A nice ventilation system is in place. Didn t use a/c because it was cold enough already with the weather. There was a small fridge in the room along with hairdryer and hand soap in the bathroom - all things we appreciated. Breakfast (if included) is served on the upper veranda overlooking the river. Breakfast was appreciated. Coffee with milk didn t seem to have milk. Ordered omelets both days, first day it was good, second day it was great. Water filter on property was appreciated. Bike rental is inexpensive and condition of the bikes were quite good. Location is great as it is only a 5-10 minute bike ride into the old city. It s also located right along the river. Nearby there are restaurants. Luan, the madame of the guesthouse was helpful, friendly and professional. We felt quite welcome. There were a few miscommunications regarding prices charged and extending our stay luan was very accomodating and strived to make us very pleased guests, as she did. Overall, very nice value for what we paid."

Hội An,Azalea Homestay,GoogleMap,Darren & Alice,"10,0",13/01/2017,"This homestay was superb and we were sad to leave. The rooms are spacious and had lots of natural light. The air-con unit is silent. There is a mini bar with prices that match any local shop you visit (10,000 for water). Daily room cleaning if you want it. Tv with good movie channels. Breakfast is eggs, baguette and a plate of various fruit with a tea or coffee and this sets you up for the day. The family also cook local breakfast which are delicious. The staff are really friendly. We cooked and eat with the family on christmas day which was an amazing experience and made christmas really fun. We loved our stay here and would highly recommend to anyone."

Hội An,Babylon Villa,Traveloka,Arvin,"10,0",27/10/2022,"We arrived at the property one late evening, a day after a massive typhoon swept through. We had travelled long and had 2 very tired and hungry kids ... There was a massive power outage at the property and in all the immediate surrounding areas. In all, it was pitch black ..... We could not stay at the property for obvious reasons but the owner, tan, was extremely generous and compassionate. He took us in, made us comfortable with what little he had and took me around patiently on his motorbike to find other hotels in the nearby town where there was power, while my family waited in his home. After helping to secure a room, he transported us and our luggage to the hotel in his car. He refused anything we would offer as a gesture of thanks, wished us well and went on his way. He also promptly refunded all monies paid to secure his property. Our biggest regret was not being able to return his generosity. It was an absolutely amazing start to what could have been a tough stay given the typhoon devastation - i am sure his property would have been exactly as how it is depicted in expedia. I hope we can return the kindness with a long stay in the future. Hoi an is a absolute must see place (typhoon or not) - rich tapestry of history, culture and cuisine."

They do everything to ensure that the guests have a good stay. For example, we were picked up in their private car from somewhere in the city and driven to the hotel. We were driven to the beach, to tailors in the old town, help to book a private driver who drove us to our next stop. On the trip to hue, we stopped at the marble mountains. A place worth visiting. We also stopped at a beautiful lake. All this was arranged by our host couple. We give them our very best recommendations. Definitely a good place to live."

Leider bestätigte sich unser verdacht! wir hatten um 12 00 uhr ausgeckeckt und weil es mir gesundheitlich nicht gut ging, waren wir bereits um 12 10 wieder im hotel und fragten, ob wir nochmal in das selbe zimmer gehen dürfen. Die frau an der reception sagte, dass das zimmer schon geputzt worden sei, wir aber trotzdem wieder rein gehen können (haben nochmals 1 nacht bezahlt). Nicht ganz unerwartet stellten wir fest, dass der bettbezug nicht gewechselt wurde, da der eine fleck auf dem bettbezug immer noch am selben ort war. Nur die duschtücher wurden gewechselt.

Hội An,Beachfront Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,dianne,"6,0",07/09/2018,Hotel is across the road from the silk resort which they have a deal with so you can use the facilities. Silk is on the beach. The view from their photos is not at all what you actually get. It s clean and the staff are nice but i would rather stay at an bang beach. If you do go make sure you have coffee and cake and the bakery behind the hotel.

The breakfast was delicious, but it was a bit disappointing that the menu was almost the same every day. However, there were a few issues - even though we paid extra for a reservation for three people, including our son, only two sets of towels were provided. Even when we requested more, only two sets were left again the next day, and we had to call every day to request an extra set, which was inconvenient. At other hotels, the number of towels was adjusted to match the number of guests after the first day, so this was disappointing. - we reserved the hotel s shuttle service, but the car smelled of tobacco, which was very unpleasant. If you are sensitive to cigarette smells, it s probably best to make a request in advance. - the pool water was cloudy and didn t seem very clean, so families with children should be cautious! ---"

This resort has expanded and we stayed in the new wing which was gorgeous and as we were on the 7th floor we were right near the rooftop pool, which i used every morning. Some of the staff remembered us from our previous stay which was nice. We received a very warm welcome on our arrival and outstanding service for the entire stay. All staff were exceptionally friendly and the guys manning the pool went over and beyond. It was my sister s birthday during our stay and reception organised a cup cake and candle and we all sang happy birthday during breakfast which was so nice. Adding to this, the cleaning staff put a happy birthday message made from flowers and towels in the shape of a cake on the bed. Location is superb, massage and laundry across the road at very good prices. Old town just down the road and we used the bicycles a couple of times during our stay which was fun. We caught the shuttle bus to the beach most days and stayed there for a couple of hours. Thanks for such a nice experience and look forward to returning in 2025!"

Sự tinh tế khi chuẩn bị thiệp chào mừng, rồi đến phần bánh chúc mừng sinh nhật từ dịch vụ của khách sạn mặc dù mình không hề báo trước. Nếu báo trước khách sạn sẽ chuẩn bị chu đáo hơn nữa. Điều mình thích là mặc dù chỉ ở 1 hôm, nhưng lúc đi ăn tối thì phòng lại được dọn dẹp sạch sẽ trở lại như ban đầu, khác với những nơi khác mình từng đi. Phòng mình chọn cũng rất đẹp và mát, 2 view và có ban công, nếu được nên có 1 bộ bàn trà ở ban công thì tuyệt! nếu có dịp gia đình mình sẽ quay lại lần sau. Đánh giá 5 sao"

Phòng mình nhận thì toàn tóc là tóc, mình cảm giác như là nhân viên chỉ quét dọn sơ sơ đoàn trước xong xếp phòng cho mình thuê vậy. Ly nước thì cáu bẩn vàng khè nhìn không dám uống. Chỗ kệ để đồ thì toàn bụi là bụi, quơ tay lên là 1 lớp bụi. Được cái phòng rộng, nhiều giường, đi gia đình thì thấy thoải mái. Cầu thang trơn, mặc dù có lót chống trượt nhưng miếng lót không được gia cố nên khi đi xe sộc xệch, sáng sớm nay hội an mưa nên sáng nay tầm 7h hơn mình trả phòng nền cầu thang còn ướt đọng nước, đi muốn trượt."

Vì bộ định tuyến nằm ngay bên ngoài phòng. Ngay cả khi ngồi ở đó cũng sẽ gây ra kết nối chập chờn. Không cung cấp khăn tắm lớn, cần phải trả thêm tiền cho nó. Nhưng ngay cả khi có khăn tắm thì nó cũng quá nhỏ, không thể che phủ toàn bộ cơ thể. Nếu tôi muốn che mông thì phần trên của tôi sẽ bị lộ ra, nếu tôi muốn che phần trên của mình thì phần dưới của tôi sẽ bị lộ ra. Bàn được cung cấp quá cao so với ghế của họ. Tôi hơi cao hơn mức trung bình nhưng tôi phải giơ tay lên để gõ máy tính. Giường quá đàn hồi đến nỗi tôi không thể ngủ ngon. Xung quanh khá ồn ào, gà sẽ bắt đầu lúc 3 giờ sáng và dừng vào khoảng 6-7 giờ sáng. Những con chó xung quanh sẽ đánh nhau vào ban đêm. Và có rất nhiều muỗi, chúng cắn ngón tay và môi của tôi. Có thể nghe thấy tiếng chúng bay quanh tai tôi vào ban đêm, cực kỳ đáng sợ. Hệ thống nước nóng thật kinh khủng. Phải bật shopee ít nhất 5-10 phút trước khi nóng lên. Sau đó, nhiệt độ sẽ dao động rất nhiều nên bạn chắc chắn sẽ bị cảm lạnh vào mùa đông. Nhân viên thân thiện, lễ tân buổi sáng và an ninh ban đêm tuyệt vời. Ngoài điều đó ra thì thật kinh khủng, đừng đến đây. Đây là một trong những nơi lưu trú có chi phí cao nhất trong khu vực. Tôi có thể tìm được những nơi tốt hơn xung quanh"

You are not just a room number like some hotels, they actually remember you and treat you like family. This was our 3rd stay there which says everything! far enough away from the madness in the old town but not too far that you cant have a stroll by the river to go and explore and taxis are cheap enough if you dont want to walk. Would recommend betel to anyone wanting a relaxing time in lovely surroundings"

Hội An,Betel Garden Villas,Traveloka,Rhona,"10,0",28/08/2018,"This was our favourite hotel on our recent vietnam holiday. Not so much a hotel as a collection of small villas set in the well kept, peaceful grounds of a family home. There is a swimmming pool which is in very good condition and never busy due to the small guest numbers. The restaurant had good food and was reasonably priced. One evening all the guests were invited to dinner (free!) which was amazingly generous. Free bikes available if you wanted to cycle to the old town centre (about 10 mins) or to the beach (about 20). Hoian itself is very touristy but still well worth a couple of trips (especially in the evening when the lanterns are lit). The beach is also good. Clean and not busy despite going on a saturday. Thanks to all the staff, especially to the very friendly kim!"

Hội An,Betel Garden Villas,Traveloka,Seth,"10,0",18/04/2023,We stayed 5 nights at betel garden villas and loved our stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel property is beautiful. Our 2 year old loved swimming in the pool and looking at the birds and fish on the property. The breakfast was delicious. We stayed in a bungalow which gave us a lot of space and the front patio was nice to relax on at the end of the day. I would say that our bathroom could use some upkeep. The shower was a little dated and we had difficulty controlling the water temperature. The water would also pool around the shower borders. We would still stay here again and recommend it to anyone who asked! they have bikes available and 1 with a child seat attached. It is about a 25-30 minute walk to old town (with a 2 year old). Multiple great restaurants within a 10 minute walk. Definitely recommend!

The concierge provided excellent recommendations for tailors and spas, and the included cooked-to-order breakfasts were lovely.

Hotellet är enkelt och billigt men räkna inte med att sola vid poolen för det är sällan solen når dit. Fina och bra restauranger vid vattnet nära. Vi fick rum som hade väldigt mycket fukt i sig och i det ena rummet var det så fuktigt att täckena var blöta, luktade fukt och kemikalier. Det andra rummet gick inte att mörklägga helt för det var glas ut mot korridoren. De uppgraderade oss och det blev bättre. Men be att få kolla rummen innan ni accepterar.

Great breakfast food selection as well as themed dinner option. Public pool and lounge area is clean and very relaxing, truly a calm oasis in hoi an.

The bonsai trees outside were out of this world as were the other small additions and i couldn t recommend highly enough. As for any trips etc autumn organised all this for us and couldn t have helped more. Thank you so much for a great stay xxxx"
Hội An,Bonsai Homestay,Traveloka,Tom,"10,0",22/03/2025,"Et dejligt lille hotel i gåafstand til det huserende gadeliv med boder, marked, gadekøkkener og dejlige restauranter. Hotellet drives af en familie som er utrolig hjælpsomme og imødekommende. Værelserne er rene og pæne og har det nødvendige man har brug for. Morgenmaden vælges om aftenen der er flere valgmuligheder, fra æg i flere variationer til frugt og juice, vi supplerede selv med lidt ost da dette ikke var med på mad kortet. Der er cykler som kan lejes og der er dejlige cykel områder i omegnen. Vi vil helt sikkert komme igen til dette lille stille hotel hvor alt ånder af hygge"
Hội An,Bonsai Homestay,Traveloka,Andrea Haugen,"10,0",08/05/2025,"We lived at bonsai villa for 3 nights. Small and very cosy hotel. The owner is really nice and made sure we had a great stay. The room is clean and the yard with the pool is quiet. The location of the hotel is great. Quiet atmosphere and only a 10 minute walk to the centre of old town. The hotel has bicycles so you can get around easily. We didn t use them, but probably would have if we were staying longer. The breakfast was delicious! we were lucky and got an extra hour before check out to just chill by the pool. Thanks for a lovely stay! we recommend this place to anyone traveling to hoi an."

Hội An,Boutique Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Zeynep,"8,0",01/06/2019,After staying 4 days in hoi an town i wanted to spend my last 4 days right on the beach. I really enjoyed the nice clean beach and the pool area. But all in all it was the least friendly hotel i experienced in my 2 weeks vietnam tour. It might have been different for someone else. I had one dinner at the hotel and that was the bbq night which i did not find very good. But most of all i was extremely annoyed by the fact that it was a total non smoking hotel. You only were allowed to smoke on the far right side of the beach. Not even on your balcony! i did not follow that rule and always went to my terrace to have my cigarette. That s is also the reason i did not dine at the hotel except that first evening because i need my smoke during meals especially if it is outside. The free shuttle gave me the opportunity to go into town for dinner.

The pool area was also beautiful, although i have to admit i spent most of my time at the beach. The beach bar was one of my favorite spots to relax and have a drink in a stunning beachfront setting and the breakfast buffet was great. The room we had was also fantastic - large, lots of light, very clean, and just super comfortable and calming to be in. The staff was so friendly and accommodating, and we felt totally taken care of the entire time, and the free shuttle into old town was a great perk that the hotel offers.

I recommend getting one of the suits then you get view of the grounds when you wake up which is beautiful. The rooms are spacious with everything you could need. The resort it s self is a 20 min drive from hoi an town. But with the free shuttle bus or grab (uber for asia) you can get into town when ever for about 4, 2 if you dare to take a bike. We found it nice to be out of the town it s self as it can be incredibly busy and noisy, great for a few hours but not 24/7."

Hội An,Boutique Hoi An Resort,Traveloka,Kristian,"8,0",16/08/2025,"Virkelig smukt beach resort i ægte koloni-stil få km uden for hoi an. Store og meget rene værelser med balkon/terrasse og mange med udsigt til pool/have eller hav (vi boede i et premier room). Flotte bygninger, flot have og lige ud til en meget fin privat strand. Lækker morgenmad, lille men godt gym, gratis shuttlebus til byen flere gange dagligt (og retur). Virkelig effektiv laundry service og housekeeping. Der er spa på stedet, men vi var der kun en enkelt gang (og har prøvet bedre i vietnam). Vi var super glade for vores ophold i hoi an og kommer meget gerne igen. Jeg vil dog ikke kalde det for et boutique hotel med så mange værelser. Det er mere et resort for mange europæere og australiere, så vær forberedt på at liggestolene er godt booket allerede ved morgenmaden. Derimod er der masser af plads på stranden og der serveres virkelig gode juicer og iskaffe ved både pool-/og strandbar. Når hotellet ikke får topkarakter skyldes det alene, at personalet er meget lidt proaktivt og meget lidt smilende. Det var en meget stor kontrast til det, vi ellers oplevede på vores rundrejse i vietnam. Hotellet ligger ud til en stor vej, hvilket også fremgår af flere anmeldelser. Det er dog ikke noget du bemærker, når du er på resortet, da alle værelser vender ud mod haven (så vidt vi kunne se). Der er meget roligt på området (når de offentlige højtalere fra vejen ikke lige kommer med beskeder/musik)."

Just make sure that if you use the on-site dress-making service you go in there with a clear idea of what you want, what type of fabric and the colour(s). We found that the on-site dress-making service was not proactive in recommending designs and styles and that it was all very much down to you.

Hội An,Brother Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",19/11/2019,Room was nice and the bed was super comfy. Breakfast was really nice also - the best i ve had so far in vietnam. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Location was good - quieter area and only a short stroll from the hub of activity. Only issue was there were a lot of bugs in my room. Upon arrival the door to my room was open (as were others that were not yet occupied) hence the bugs. Door should be kept close to keep the bugs out.

Hội An,Brother Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Kurt,"8,0",02/11/2019,"I don t usually write reviews but as this is a new premises and the team were so friendly, i thought i would say a few words. The location was great for me. It is a few hundred metres from the city and the start of the old city. It took about 5-10 minutes to get to the city centre but was quiet at night as there is no real passing traffic. The building itself is finished to a high quality. The bathrooms were well presented with above average fixtures. The rooms were quite and well appointed with good mattress, pillows, linens and black-out curtains. Tv is a modern unit with the usual entertainment channels a westerner looks for. There are also the asian cable channels, too. The pool and the atrium opening roof above was a nice touch that will keep with the water cool in the warmer months and heat it up a little in the cooler ones. The staff were very friendly and were happy for a chat as we got a feel for what we wanted to do in hoi an. Breakfast was a great omelette and baguette with salad. Other options are available. The team are still finding their feet but i had no complaints. I ll stay here again without doubt next time we visit hoi an for a long weekend."

We booked for 3 nights, but if we would have known what the hotel and staff were like we would have booked for a week. The girls on the front desk were so attentive and got to know who you were straight away. My parter left her phone in a grab taxi and they helped us contact the driver and get it back to us. The rooms were amazing with great air conditioning. Mini bar prices were the same as restaurants around us for soft drinks and water. We did our laundry there with they charged for by the kilo, can t remember the price, but it was really cheap. They arranged a car for us to get to the airport and it was the same price as grab. We took advantage of the free bikes and rode into the old town. I can t speak highly enough about this hotel, one of the best we ve stayed. Really close to the beach and loads of little restaurants to choose from close by. A grab taxi to the old town cost just over a 1 stirling and a moped about 80 pence. Just an amazing hotel with even better staff"

There is no spa, no restaurant, no coffee bar, no free beach shuttle, despite all being listed as amenities. We were able to borrow bikes but it took 45 minutes despite us asking the night before as they all needed maintenance work doing to them. We also had a negative experience with some neighbouring guests who had loud music blaring until 1 30am, as well as running around shouting and banging on other doors. When we raised this as midnight over text we did not get a reply from anyone, and the next morning we did not receive apology of any sorts and the owner tried to justify by informing us that they were college students. We didn t feel this was appropriate given there were other guests staying. The place has potential to be a good stay, but it needs to alter the listing to be accurate to what is available, and the staff need to take guest satisfaction a little more seriously."

What great advise that was. We struck gold. This venue is modern and well maintained. It is situated within easy walking distance to old town where the action is. The staff are magnificent. They are professional, friendly and helpful plus they have a detailed knowledge of the local environment. As a bonus most have an excellent working knowledge of english. The rooms are spotlessly clean and spacious. They are efficiently serviced each day. It has a secluded pool available to cool off on those hot days. The buffet breakfast is a food lovers delight with the menu aimed at the local market as well as those with a western palate. The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. This hotel is exceptional in terms of venue and price. Without hesitation i give it my highest recommendation. We will return here on our next visit."

Since it was also tet (vietnamese new year) during our visit, the hotel also gave us lucky money (red packets) and tangerines which was a nice touch. The breakfast fare included traditional vietnamese foods alongside the standard toast and cereal. Definitely enjoyed that! location-wise, the hotel is tucked away from the bustling traffic on the main road, but still close enough to all the nearby attractions. The only downside was that patrons of the cafe next door can get quite loud and noisy. But overall, this was an amazing and certainly memorable stay!"

Pros staff, staff, staff, they were attentive when i had a question, gave great recommendations for tours and shopping. The rooms are well appointed and large, very clean and the beds are incredibly comfortable. Breakfast included is nice too but read the con below. Cons it is further away from the old town, but only about a 15 minute walk. But that doesn t really make it quieter. There is a lot of construction and because life is lived early in vietnam and outside you will hear people talking and laughing and motorbikes at all hours. Breakfast was abundant but definitely not made for vegetarians, there weren t many choices as even most of the salads had meat in them. But for anyone else i think they would love it."

The buffet breakfast, with eggs made to order, is fantastic. You have lots of western and vietnamese choices. The staff are welcoming and helpful. They are always willing to serve you. The hotel is a bit outside of the centre (about 10 minutes walk), but that is a good thing (the old town can get a bit loud and crazy). Note as of september 2019, there is a building under construction right next to the hotel, so there can be some noise and dust, but we had no issues with it."

The staff is super friendly and helpful, especially miss v, she is amazing. As i arrived from ho chi minh very late, she greeted me with a welcome drink and very detailed personal tourist suggestion. Actually i try almost everything she recommended and almost everyone of them are great. The only issue is the location which is far away from town and the the neighborhood is not so nice but the supreme service the hotel provides simply resolved the problem. If i were once have the chance to come back, i will definitely stay in the same place."

If you pick it try to meet and talk with the store owners also. Super sweet sisters and their husbands. Everything was fabulous.

Hội An,Cozy Savvy Boutique Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Timothy,"10,0",07/03/2020,"My biggest concern was the location. On a map, it looked good but wasn t right in the thick of it. This is a blessing! it is so close to everywhere you want to be but perfectly placed just outside the chaos. I was happy about that. I walked easily to and from the hotel to all the places i wanted to see. Hoi an is such a cool place and great walking city that it didn t allow me to enjoy the hotel as much as i wanted to because it is sooooo nice and has such great amenities. The rooftop had a lovely bar and pool which i wasn t able to enjoy but did get to see (weather wasn t pool time weather). The restaurant was tasty and had lots of options - free breakfast was amazing and they have a nice coffee bar that can concoct more exotic coffee drinks rather than your typical morning cup of coffee. The rooms were lovely and spacious. The bathroom was probably my favorite of all the places i stayed in. It was bight, spacious, airy, loaded with amenities, and the tub was huge! the staff was extremely helpful and gracious. Helen specifically helped me with any questions or concerns i had. They booked any connections i needed or made available a scooter at my disposal. This hotel i can t recommend enough. I definitely need to return to stay longer than i did. Hoi an is such a great city and demands longer than 2 days."

Hội An,Flamingo Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Kai,"10,0",01/06/2018,"Staying at flamingo villa hoi an was a pleasant and comfortable experience. We stayed for 2 nights and there staff was every bit hospitable and friendly from start to end. Breakfast was provided each morning and we could choose from a variety of food choices the night before. The staff was so hospitable that they made sure to shift the tables and chairs under the shade when the sun shone too brightly on them. Location wise, the hotel is down a quieter alley (alley way had houses and was always lit so never an issue) right in the old town and so it made traveling to and fro anywhere very very convenient. The hotel had both bicycles and motorbikes for rent too. They also arranged for our transport to danang international airport on our last day there (280k vnd) for a 7 seater. The only catch would be that there s no lift there - it was homestay-style and so it may be inconvenient for those with difficulties with stairs. Overall a great stay and would recommend it to anyone!"

I chose this hotel because it is in a quiet location 10 minutes walk from the town, so it was disappointing that there is currently building work next door, with loud noise from 7am on three of the four mornings i was staying at the hotel. The net curtains over the windows in my room were very dirty at the bottom, and they could really do with a wash.

The night market was located across the bridge and then the shopping stalls begin so we didn t need to walk too far to get to the stalls, however google says it s about an 18 minute walk from the hotel to the midst of the night market so take that into account. However, because the hotel is located further away, it was much more quiet, peaceful and tranquil. Very clean as well. It was easy to arrange an airport transfer through this hotel via email before our trip and they called us to verify we were on the 16 seater we booked from the airport."

The buffet breakfast on day one was very good but were surprised on arrival for breakfast on day two when the buffet was not available. Turns out the staff decided there were not enough people to have a buffet. A minimal a la carte breakfast was offered instead.

The breakfast buffet is delicious, and it has a wide variety of food to choose from. The omelettes are the best made with fresh eggs. Most of all, the staff is a top-notch team who deserves recognition for their professionalism and attentiveness to details. We were amazed at how hard they work together to accommodate the guests. They always provided service with such wonderful smiles and a bit of humor! the desk staff (ruby and henry) really shine when it comes to providing recommendations, making reservations, arranging transportation, purchasing show tickets or tours, and tracking laundry services. We are now in da nang, and truly miss the gemside river resort, especially the staff. If we go back to hoi an, we would not hesitate to book here again. Thumbs up and hope to see you all soon."

She is an absolute credit to the hotel and made our stay really comfortable and memorable. The hotel itself is stunning and the room was amazing. The location is great, just outside of hoi an so a 5min grab ride which is very cheap, or about a 20min walk so it s nearby without the noise and crowds. Also the hotel has multiple free shuttles every day into and out of hoi an so can t fault the service. Breakfast was excellent with great quality food and choice. We loved our complimentary foot massage in the spa and both pools are great for a relaxing dip and a few drinks, especially during 241 happy hour. All in all we couldn t be happier with our time at the grand sunrise palace. Would highly recommend."

All the staff is very helpful and try their best to understand. We brought some fruits from outside to the lobby and the staff was so nice by offering to cut and bring the fruits to us. Hoi an night market is 14 mins drive and the hoi an old town is only 7 mins from the hotel. The hotel offers shuttle ride to and from hoi an old town at no cost.

The best things about this hotel are 1) good service, good hotel facilities, incorporating good points of japanese hotels ( for example, washlet in the room large public bath, 2) beautiful beach, 3) some of the activities are free, 4) good food, 5) i used the spa and it was a good treatment, 6) there is an affiliated hotel in da nang city and they have a free shuttle to the city overall, i feel it was a very good stay. I would recommend it to any japanese or other asian travelers to da nang. It is a peaceful and relaxing stay. I have some advice for those who are going to visit da nang and vietnam 1) it would be helpful if you can speak a little english. 2) smile and say hello to each other. If a hotel staff says sin chao to you, i suggest you smile and say sin chao back.thank you, managers and staff. We really want to stay again"

Hội An,Grandvrio Ocean Resort Danang,Traveloka,Cameron,"10,0",19/05/2025,"Grandvrio was an excellent resort in da nang. I was deciding between this resort and the hyatt regency, and i am glad i picked grandvrio. The staff are very attentive to all needs. Welcome drinks and checkout drinks were provided, complimentary. Food was very good with several dining options. Spa services were also great. 200k vnd vouchers given for use at the property, which had beach access with shaded areas. Staff spoke english well and were very respectful to guests. I visited the hyatt for a wedding i had to attend. The property was beautiful, but was very large and lacked the close feel of grandvrio. I got the feel this is more of a local s resort, if you are looking for that vibe."

Since this resort is operated by a japanese hotel group, you can feel the thoughtful japanese hospitality throughout the property. One of the most interesting features is the japanese-style public bath, which was a unique and relaxing experience.

This family run villa has the most amazing friendly staff that are eager to make your experience in hoi an as perfect as possible. The rooms are spacious, clean and bright. The rooms have a super cold minibar fridge with cold drinks that are very fairly priced. The pool is incredible, especially on a hot day. Our favourite staff member was lap she works in the afternoons. She s so sweet and makes sure you have everything you need including if the weather is bad she wants to make sure you don t get wet and gives out rain ponchos. You can rent motorcycles for fairly cheap (110,000 dong for a newer honda automatic with lots of power). The complementary breakfast is amazing with an option of 13 different choices with vietnamese and traditional western foods as options. They also have amazing fresh fruit juices and authentic vietnamese coffee. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone."

We came to the place a bit early but were allowed to gain access to a room anyway, plus a free upgrade. The room was clean but it smelled a bit, might be the old building. We were moved to another room with a balcony and it was amazing. Rented mopeds for a very fair price. The staff and owners invite us to a new years feast with the rest of the guess living there.

Overall, we were really happy with us stay at hadana. It started off being contacted by thuan sending a whatsapp message even prior to our stay getting us all set up with a pick up car to the hotel. Then greeted at the hotel upon arrival was great, cute character boutique hotel experience explained everything by thuan whilst the other staff collected our bags - a great check-in experience. The hotel itself seem to be conveniently located being only five minutes drive outside from ho an ancient town, a convenience store as well as restaurants and barbershops all around and a couple cafes the hotel itself seem to be targeted at a more elderly demographic which made a little bit more challenging for us to use the pool facilities as we are a little worried about making too much noise particularly with having kids under six years old. The pool is in the centre of the whole hotel with all the balconies overlooking so you do feel a little exposed by making too much noise with the kids. The room sizes are great. We had to purchase two rooms inter connecting and the staff were always very efficient with getting our rooms cleaned daily and also an evening turned down service which was really nice to have. The gym admittedly was pathetic, so don t even bother thinking about that everything else was just nice, we would definitely reco"

Advantages being that it s quiet and away from the very touristy areas which can get very busy. The walk to the night market, river is about 12-15 minutes. The hotel is otherwise great. Pleasant staff, some who are trained well to sell excursions. We had a couple of misunderstandings which would have been avoided if they provided written information to know what is included and not. Otherwise they were very informative and knowledgable. The rooms are great. We got interconnecting rooms which the kids loved as they felt they were independent. We stayed at a relatively quiet time but can imagine the pool getting very busy when it s peak time. Note that the hotel will charge you for everything - which other places don t. So be mindful of this. Otherwise a nice hotel which we enjoyed staying at."

It s fine for the money but the quality isn t super great. Breakfast isn t great (flies all over the food), the rooms are ok for a couple of nights apart from the wardrobe which has about 5 hangers there is no other storage space, not one drawer which is a bit annoying. The gym consists of 2 pieces of equipment but has no a/c so is pretty much unusable in the warm weather. The pool area is fairly small and the quality of sunbeds / towels isn t great. Staff are friendly, however, the hotel has a bbq once a week and there is a pretty hard sell on it from the staff..it became a bit annoying after a while so much so we ended up avoiding the staff. One positive is the location, you can walk into the old town in 10 mins, they also have free bikes to use."

We were also told the hotel was upgrading its rooms, so that s positive news - our room was clean, spacious and had a decent farm view, though it had seen better days. Bathroom setup also needed attention, like longer spouts for taps to minimise splashing outside of sink and tub. We had to mop up the wetness with towels to keep the counter and floor dry. Breakfast was generous and varied. Staff overall were friendly and responsive."

Även frukosten var riktigt bra. De bjöd på en god phô som personalen gjorde iordning medan man tog sig. Det fanns även massor med frukt, bröd, äggröra och allt annat man skulle kunna ha.

The over powering scent of essential oils in the room gave me a headache. Everyone and everything else was wonderful, although i want to give this place a high score. Cleanliness, is priority."

Hội An,Hoi An Babylon Riverside Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",31/08/2023,房間的冷氣太熱了 調到最低晚上睡覺起來還是流汗 浴室的浴缸不太方便要很小心地進出 飯店早餐種類偏少 最好吃的是水果 check in時櫃台未先說明什麼東西是需要付費的 等我們check out了踏出大門的時候 才把我們叫回去說瓶裝水是要付費的 雖然價錢不高但就是感覺不太好
Hội An,Hoi An Babylon Riverside Hotel & Spa,GoogleMap,Sara,"8,0",27/03/2024,"The property was well decorated, authentic and the staff so welcoming and lovely and made it a wonderful stay. They are extending the property so there is construction noise during the day, but you mostly can t hear it, and we were out during the day most of the time anyway. The rooftop pool is nice and cool, and a great way to unwind after a hot day in the sun. Wifi works well, the noodles are great for the free breakfast otherwise they have basic other bits for a snack before heading out - transport or taxis were easy to get, but it was only a 10 min walk into town (if that) anyhow, i do recommend this hotel as it s close to everything but not in the busiest parts of hoi an."

I think we went at wrong month as was extremely hot and no shade over pool although they had umbrellas around pool lounges! overall very good value and location, was probably the noise at night that detracted from overall experience. Also got double charged on mini bar as paideia it might before but had early check out and staff made me pay again as we were waiting to go! wasn t much but was just a bit annoying as i tried to do right thing night before when settling account"

Hotellet tilbyr gratis transport (minibuss) til og fra sentrum 3 ganger daglig. Gratis håndkleservice. Meget god frokost. Godt utvalg, samt kokk som lager bl.a omelett, speilegg etc og phô. Vi spiste også middag på hotellet en kveld, og fikk god service og veldig god mat. Rent og ryddig uteområde. Treningsrom med 3 tredemøller, 2 sykler, styrkeapparat og manualer. Vi hadde også en 60 min massasje ved hotellets spa. Massasjen var meget bra, men de kunne godt gjort litt mer ut av spa et, f.eks kunne det gjerne vært litt musikk i behandlingsrommet, og gjerne noe vann eller te når vi var ferdig. Hyggelig betjening i resepsjonen. Behjelpelige med booking av utflukter etc. Vi var uheldige med været da vi var der, men dersom vi hadde hatt sol og dermed bedre utbytte av basseng/strand ville oppholdet vært 10/10."

We arrived late around 10 30pm and the smell of jasmine and gardenias was thick in the air. We rode bikes into town (about 2 miles away) and had shoes , dresses, suit pants and shirts made- amazing! the market was great, the walk along the river at night with lit laterns were beautiful and the street food and restaurants were good.

Other than this minor issue all else in the dining area was great. Some mould obvious in shower cubicle which we endeavoured to ignore. Again worth mentioning however would certainly not discourage visiting again and for sure recommend to friends and family. Other than these two minor moans we absolutely enjoyed each and every day .. Well less enjoyed the few dull / colder days. Hope all staff maintain the same high standards and attitude it s a winning combination for continued success. Thank you all.

Parin pienen korjauksen, oven kahvan ja allas putken kiristyskorjauksen jälkeen, mikä tapahtui heti aamulla, tuli kysely onko kaikki nyt ok. Parannettavaa hotellin ranta ei vastanut kuvia, oli rakennettu aaltovalli ja uimaan pääseminen ei onnistunut eikä ranta baari toiminut. Hotelli kompensoi toisella viikolla asiaa hotellin bussi kuljetuksella 3km päähän yleiselle rannalle. Hotellin 4kpl tietokoneista yksi toimi jotenkin.

Hội An,Hoi An Beach Resort,Traveloka,Pia,"8,0",07/04/2020,"Jag hade en mycket fin vistelse men som avslutades på ett sätt som inte var planerat. Lördagen den 14 mars vid 19 på kvällen fick jag ett a-4 papper där jag och alla övriga boende på hotellet meddelades att söndagen den 15 mars skulle alla boende flyttas till ett annat hotell pga att lokala myndigheter bestämt att hoi an beach resort skulle stängas tillsvidare från och med 15 mars jag valde då att korta ner min vistelse med en dag och istället boka flyg hem till sverige fortast möjligt. Jag var inte intresserad av flyttas till ett annat hotell utan få tydligt och klart förklarat för mig varför och vad som var den egentliga meningen. Jag bad om att få en refund på den sista natten som därmed inte skulle bli utnyttjad pga detta. Det lovades att jag skulle bli kontaktad via mejl under dagen 15 mars av ansvarig chef,för att få en refund, men det har ännu inte skett. Jag tror att hoi an beach resort är ett underbart ställe att besöka under tider då vi inte har ett corona virus som ställer till det i världen. Flera av dom boende från andra länder hade samma dag blivit uppringda av deras ud och beordrade att ta sig hem snabbast möjligt för att inte fastna i vietnam eller på vägen hem pga att regler och direktiv ändrades timma för timma särskilt i vietnam.

A couple of areas are still closed after covid lockdowns but will reopen once business picks up again. My balcony opened onto the river and rooms opposite had gardens. Make sure to catch at least one sunrise from the beach directly across the road - it s well worth it. The old town is about a 10min taxi ride (about 100000vdn) and there s lots of shops, restaurants/cafes and street food 200m up the road. I will stay here again for sure when i return to hoi an."
Hội An,Hoi An Beach Resort,Traveloka,Diane,"8,0",05/08/2022,"Prijs/kwaliteit best oke. Er zijn nog heel wat verbeter puntjes maar iedereen doet zijn best. We hadden een kamer met uitzicht op de rivier - heel leuk. De koelkast op de kamer bij de kinderen koelde niet maar gelukkig konden ze het water bij ons in de koelkast kwijt. Zwembad is leuk (enige is dat het water veeeel te warm was, je kon echt niet afkoelen maar ook in de zee was het warm trouwens). Het onderhoud kon iets beter maar niet om te zeggen dat het vuil was. Jammer dat er geen bar is om een drankje te bestellen. Wij waren amper in het hotel (steeds op uitstap dus we hebben maar heel kort aan het zwembad gezeten). Er is een gratis shuttle service naar de oude stad dus dat is heel handig. Het ontbijt mocht gerust wel iets uitgebreider. Het is echt afgestemd op de vietnamezen. Voor ons was er mogelijkheid tot een ei, een toaster en een worstje. En daar eindigt de westerse keuze helaas. Er was wel yoghurt in een potje maar die was niet gekoeld jammer genoeg. Het personeel is wel vriendelijk en behulpzaam"

The staff was very caring with us they helped us with a laundry while we were away on a tour and had the nicest attention for my girlfriends birthday. As in pretty much all hotels in sea, the soundproofing could be better, so just bring earplugs. The location is also good, a few minutes away from the city center of hoian, in a quiet alley.

Hội An,Hoi An Central Boutique Hotel and Spa,Traveloka,Andrew,"6,0",28/11/2019,"There are things i enjoyed and things that could be improved about this hotel. The initial communication with the hotel was great however, while the staff were attentive and kind, i felt that it was difficult to speak with them when i was there. I did believe that the staff did try their best to do what they can. The hotel is about four years old, but it feels older. The walls were leaking during the heavy rain, which probably will mean that mold will grow later if they do not fix it. The room itself felt like it wasn t fully clean with dusty floors and soap stains on the shower glass. The location of the hotel is about 10 minutes from the old town. The hotel does have a private beach with a shuttle however, the shuttle is so inconsistent that even the staff recommends to take a taxi back. The hotel also felt like it was constantly advertising for its excursions, spas and gifts not just in the lobby, but with all the pamphlets in the room - that s fine that they want to show their other products but it felt constant. For a four star hotel, i believe that they could do better."

The staff went out of their way to entertain and take care of our girl. For example, when she fell into the rice-fired, immediately a staff member was there to clean her shoes. We have never felt more welcome than at the chic hotel."

We would borrow the bicycles everyday and ride to where ever we wanted to go, which was never really any more that 10 - 15 minutes away, and the staff we always so helpful to give us tips on where to go and what to see. The room was beautiful and we loved waking up there each morning. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed and very well designed. The other hotel guests we felt we very similar to ourselves and showed respect for one another, as noise was kept to a minimum. Everyone was just great here, if we ever find ourselves in vietnam in the future we will certainly book here again."

We ate one evening in the restaurant and can recommend the seafood clay pot, tiger prawns in tamarind sauce and morning glory. All delicious and reasonably priced.

The service was so so , check in was good but thereafter it was pretty bland - it just didn t have that welcoming nor friendly vibe. Location was not as good as i thought i felt a bit isolated. Even though there was a shuttle to and from hoi an and the beach, times did not always works so we paid for taxis. It wasn t a hotel where you could walk out or down the road to eat or see something yes it s peace and quiet but come 7am all the noise starts - people walking by, doors slamming , housekeeping. I m normally a deep sleeper and being on holiday i would like a lie in and relax but i found i was woken early by this. It was an ok hotel and im glad i only stayed 3ngts.

I did my research and this looked like a great high lvl place but could be better. Service was good, staff friendly, food good, cocktails great and strong a great way to start the night. Rooms 7/10. Bed 5/10 hard. Service 9/10 free shuttle bus service to ancient toen and beach 9/10 they need more times though. Communication on w /app or sms and oversll 10/10. Room service laundry 9/10 and very fair price per kilo and fast 1 day return was great. . I would recommend the mid or low priced rooms in the main building. Imo dont waist your money on the more xc rooms. For some reason offered to show us they rooms in main building at a lowe rate and we declined as we wanted the size of the club sweet with large balcony and bath lake view. Rooms in the main building would be better choice imo at mid to low lvl price structures they offer. The club suits need tlc and the beds are hard af.. My mrs dint get a good nights sleep in 5 nights on the hard bed. Limited service in club sweet area fyi but very quiet as i like it. That said this eco lodge is a good option for the open minded and mid to low budget priced traveler. Be sure to try a cocktail lol."

They all smile not to lose their kindness. Especially, i could remember receptionist lady s care. She always tries to help my family and ask me if i need something. 2) food and drinks resonable price and taste way much great i liked the breakfast they serve always in the morning. Their menu and taste are reasonable. 3) hot and good photo spot everywhere!!! maybe this is sometimes only good for ppl like me who take photos hundred of times. I was so much happy to stay this resort. Because everywhere and every angle is just good scean i could see their effort of design of building and room, structure. If you are managing sns account, and you want to get beautiful photos. This resort is perfect area. 4) both family centered and couple centered resorts all must be satisfied at the end.

Hội An,Hoi An Four Seasons Villa,Traveloka,Hyeran,"8,0",25/01/2025,"You are surrounded by nature because the hotel is situated in the middle of a rice field. This could be a pleasant experience if you want to avoid the city center. We traveled during a relatively wet season, so even with the air conditioner running, the room we stayed in was a little unpleasant due to the moisture and stickiness that pervaded it. The welcoming and attentive hotel personnel can be another factor in your decision to stay here."

The staff at the hotel was very friendly and the free bicycles were a great way to get into town or to the beach. We also rented a moto through the hotel which was cheap and easily arranged. The breakfast in the hotel was fantastic, the buffet had something new every day and the pancakes they baked for us every morning were awesome! finally we also used the tailor of the hotel to make a wintercoat for my partner and a suit for me. They were very professional and were deterimined to get it right, no matter how many fittings it would be, we were very happy with the results.

Swimming pool (but no shade over it). Able to organise private taxi ( 17) to da nan for onward travel.they also recommend a good tailor. While the area is quiet, the hotel wakes up around 0700, and the noise travels through the halls. The mb (military bank) atm is half way between the hotel and town, it offers large withdrawals and no fee (all other atm s restrict withdrawal amount and charge for it).

Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"2,0",08/07/2015,"Hotel itself was outside the center, and too far of a walk (and not a pleasant one). So they have bicycles you can rent out. This is a scam/trap. Do not rent. They tell you sometimes bicycles get stolen so make sure you lock it , which should have been a sign not to take it. Well, sure enough, we parked the bicycles where all other bicycles were parked on the street and locked it, and when we came back, it was gone. We went back to the hotel and showed them the keys and explained where we parked. Without hesitation or any help in trying to locate the bicycle, they quickly told us we had to pay about 300 us. These bikes are old garbage...brand new at walmart would be 60 max in the us...probably about 15 max in vietnam, but they tried to hold our passports hostage until we paid the 300. On top of that, we had paid for their expensive taxi back to the airport the next day, and of course it did not come in time. We almost missed our flight, probably so we would come back and stay another night...as if anyone would want to come back here. Hotel staff guy was very rude and should not be the face of the hotel. Terrible experience and the worst people i ve ever met in vietnam."

Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",29/09/2015,"We stayed here for 5 nights. We liked the location, 15 minute walk to the town and about the same to cycle to the beach. They have free bikes to use which was good, free breakfast which was ok and the rooms were spacey and kept to a decent level. The problem was the staff, we hadn t even checked in when staff wanted to know when we were leaving to book our taxi . Look in the town, it was much cheaper. If you wanted to hire the bikes they wanted to know your exact route, if you were heading into town, they always knew a tailor they wanted to recommend . We had to cross over to rude which made us feel uneasy to get staff to understand that we were not interested. One staff member in particlar hung around a lot which made my other half feel very uncomfortable. We had lunch there once, after finding two hairs in my meal i couldn t finish it. Some staff members where kind and helpful however you witnessed others who would start shouting at them in vietnamese and all of a sudden they couldn t supply you with directions to the post office but if you give them so many dollars, they could make sure it was posted for you . This, being nosy and pushy let the hotel down, they may have lots of smiles for you but it all feels very uncomfortable and fake. We didn t even get to make use of the pool as other guests continuously spat in it. If you do cycle to the beach, they don t tell you you have to pay to park the bike. Check the price first as it differs."

The buffet breakfast was decent, with eggs cooked to order and a different local dish offered each day, as well as the buffet food. Jessica, on the reception desk was lovely, kind and had a great sense of humour, and ensured we had everything we needed while staying at like hoi an. She gave us some great advice and booked our tour and private driver for the same price as we could find anywhere around town. The pool was lovely and clean, and peter the f b manager was a perfect gentleman. We were well-looked after while we cooled off and enjoyed some freshly-made cocktails.

Not all westerners are rich and they wish to be protected from thieves as they are here in australia. But our stay with you was pleasant. Perhaps your hotel is a little too far from the centre.
Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Benno,"10,0",21/01/2015,"Than van 2 is a really nice hotel. We were given a cup of vietnamese tea apon arrival while we checked in. The rooms are big, comfortable beds and the showers were hot, although quite weak pressure. Complimentary water is replaced each morning. The rooms are soundproofed from outside noise by two sets of doors leading on to the balcony. Complimentary bikes were great, and the location great also. Only a few blocks north from the overly touristy (disneyland) down town area.( you actually have to pay 6 to enter the old town ) it made our stay much more pleasurable because of the location. And you can get better quality local food at local prices. The staff give you the hard sell on airport shuttles, tours, and tailored suits, when you first arrive but no more than the bombardment you will receive as soon as you hit tourist town. And they will leave you alone to enjoy your holiday as soon as you express no interest, or alternitavely sign up for some tours. The breakfast was also very good but a little sparse at times often only a few pieces of some things. They do cook eggs for you any way you like, and there is a nice selection. Over all i had a very great stay and i highly recommend than van 2."

Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Kirsty,"8,0",02/10/2014,We had comfortable time in hotel. We have been travelling for awhile now and the hotel had everything we needed for comfortable stay. It is not 5 star hotel breakfast but we really enjoyed. The manu changes. Swimming pool was wonderful and we had one day afternoon swimming pool all for ourselves. Very quiet and private it was. Room was very spacious wifh excellent room decoration. We loved staying in and being lazy in this hotel. We also liked the fact that the hotel provides shuttle to near old town. Only down fall is that there is only local restaurants around the hotel. But the hotel suggested cafe 41 which is near by for meal. It was fantastic. The hotel also has restaurant and we loved their white rose and spring rolls for snacks.

Drilling and banging starting at 0730 even on sundays. Told it would be for only 2 days ----not true ---should always be truthful not fair to us, moved bedroom due to noise--refunded 3 nights ----could not get out of lift because of scaffold. Next room better if not for leaking roof running water down walls---told front desk --nothing done, still noise continued stayed in room one morning due to industrial sanding outside our room creating a fog of choking dust. Told by hotel just before we left in e mail some noise is unavoidable disgusting comment, a refund to us of all 14nights should be the minimum compensation for our sad 25th anniversary treat.

Even though they knew with what bus company i was arriving with, what time and where. Not good service. But in general, the staff was very friendly and helpful with everything, also when i told them that my bathroom was not cleaned after the previous guests, they had someone come in and clean it immediately. I really liked their free shuttle bus service to town (ran every hour), to get you closer to the old town and/or back. It was worth it, since it was raining heavily when i stayed here.

Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"8,0",17/09/2019,"Our room got upgraded when we checked in which was a great bonus. Room was spacious, air conditioning worked well which was necessary as it had been very hot in hoi an when we visited. Staff were generally nice and welcoming. Location of hotel was a bit far from ancient town (1km) so it was not as convenient. The hotel does offer free bikes which we tried on the first day but felt the bikes were a bit wobbly and the weather was really hot to do so. It could just get a bit tricky sharing the road with lots of other motorcycles and cars. Walking was a bit far as well. I suspect that if you visit during the cooler times of the year, this would not be an issue. However, we used grab services during our stay which were super convenient and took 5-10 minutes to get to ancient town and was super cheap ( 22k vnd one way). Also some nice and cheap cafes/restaurants nearby which were handy if we didn t feel like going to ancient town for a meal. Breakfast buffet was good. The rooms had a fridge and they provided beer, soft drinks and water there but we didn t realise that these weren t free. Although they provided free bottled water each day."

It has shuttle services (based on request) every 1-2 hours which makes it up for its location. It also shuttle services to the beach twice per day which is great during summer! the modern vietnamese style room is spacious and pretty. It has everything you need and the bed is just comfortable, firm and solid! the bathroom is big and has a deep soaking tub which i enjoyed a lot. The rate also includes buffet breakfast which offers a good selection of fruits, eggs, bread and other items but make sure you go early because during the late morning, the staff wouldn t refill certain items/fruits. Service of staff was good when i stayed there except different front desk staff would often try to sell you tours or arrange airport transfers through them a couple times daily! this could get a bit annoying especially after a long day of sightseeing but you could just turn the staff down nicely and it would be fine ) . Overall i really enjoyed my stay there and think it is totally worth the value!"
Hội An,Hoi An Golden Holiday Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,David,"8,0",09/07/2016,"The room and hotel are well designed with a most attractive pool, lift, breakfast/dining area. While i was there the hotel seemed to be undergoing some kind of minor refurbishment/major clean-up and housekeeping trolleys and maintenance equipment were forever clogging the hallways. Not a major issue, just messy. The breakfast was excellent but don t expect it to get really underway until 6.30 at the earliest which can be an issue with early departing tours. When i checked out there was only one young woman who seemed to be authorised to tot up the guests bills. With a particularly pernickety tour group this was a lengthy process and of course we were all on deadlines. She did her absolute best, was unfailingly courteous (depsite patronising provocation in some cases) but the system was at fault. There were plenty of available staff, indeed one of them managed to put my bag on the tour coach which i fortunately noticed before they departed, but no-one else seemed to be authorised to prepare the accounts. But overall i enjoyed my stay. The staff were friendly, genuinely helpful and the facilities and service (apart from check-out) was excellent."

Det ligger veldig sentralt og man kan gå i ca 10 minutter for å komme inn til byen som er veldig praktisk. De ansatte var veldig imøtekommende og vennlige. Det var veldig vedlikeholdte rom og rent.

Hội An,Hoi An Gravel Pool Villa & Spa,GoogleMap,Minh Hoa Ngo,"10,0",01/06/2020,"Gia đình mình có dịp lưu trú ở đây vào đầu tháng villa hoạt động theo hình thức gia đình điều hành. Cả nhà rất thân thiện, từ lễ tân đến cô buồng phòng. Phòng ốc còn rất mới, sạch sẽ và tiện nghi. Hồ bơi rộng rãi và thoáng mát. Ăn sáng thì tạm được theo kiểu 1 tô và 1 ly. Hiện tại khách còn hạn chế nên villa sẽ nâng cấp lên buffet trong thời gian sắp đến khi mình có đóng góp với gia đình. Tuy nhiên, góp ý tí về hồ bơi cần được cải thiện khu ra vào hồ bơi giao với lễ tân cần được bố trí thảm chống trượt và hồ bơi cần trang bị phao cứu sinh hoặc áo phao. Nhìn chung, hài lòng so với giá tiền và sẽ giới thiệu bạn bè về villa này. Một lần nữa xin cảm ơn cả gia đình và mến chúc villa ngày càng đông khách."

Hội An,Hoi An Heart Villa,Traveloka,Adrienne,"8,0",21/04/2018,"Very nice room - comfortable bed, big bathtub, cozy balcony. The homestay is almost like a small hotel. The building and furnishings felt pretty new and in good condition. The staff were friendly but weren t able to give us any good recommendations for restaurants. We wanted to try local food at a local restaurant, and they only recommended morning glory and banh mi phuong which seem to be the two most touristy places to eat in hoi an. We asked if there was anything else they recommend and they just said there are many restaurants nearby but couldn t name one. The internet also stopped working during our stay and the staff just kind of shrugged and said it was working on their devices and they couldn t do anything to fix it. The breakfast was delicious - fresh eggs and bread. Yum! highly recommend staying here but you might want to do your own research on local things to do/places to eat."

Hội An,Hoi An Heart Villa,Traveloka,Anne,"10,0",20/05/2018,"We loved the friendly atmosphere surrounding this place. We got to meet and chat with a number of members of the family. (i noted they also picked up cues and left people alone who were, unlike us, not interested in engaging). They provided us with lots of useful local information. The location was a good mix of local and tourist oriented development and accommodation, with interesting walks nearby and a free bike. It was about 2.5k from the bridge at the far end of the old city (although closer to its periphery). It was also about 2.5 from cao dai beach. The more distant an bang (sp?) beach is more popular, especially since a storm took lots of the sand from cao dai away. That said, cao dai is still an attractive and, when we were there, much less crowded beach. I would recommend staying well out of the ancient town, while it is a stunning unesco site, as it is very commercial and locals there appeared on the whole to be much more money oriented. We left feeling that this place - magnolia gardens - was really special and hoping to be able to return one day. (nearby - dingo cafe for great western coffee and a chance to find out what is happening in the local expat scene)."

Hội An,Hoi An Heart Villa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",05/02/2019,"Had high hopes after reading the positive reviews. I feel that people have lowered their expectations because this is a homestay and the hosts are nice and attentive. We found most of what they had to say was apologies about what problems existed, which were numerous. Housekeeping only showed up once to clean our room during a 5 day stay, even after we asked multiple people for them to come by. You can tell that they never clean the high parts of the room or anything involving moving furniture, resulting in thick cobwebs and lots of dust. They frequently threw trash into the communal bike baskets. Laundry is double the rate of most other locations and they couldn t provide this service as they did not have a dryer and it was raining (how do they wash towels/sheets?) balcony doors not have a way to open/close once you are outside. Superior rooms do not have a water heater. Even on the day that we were the only people staying in the building, there was no hot water. Shower had poor water pressure. The 4 pool chairs are squished together, rusted, old, and you wouldn t want to sit on them with your bare skin touching. There is only one dining table inside for guests to have breakfast if it rains. They provide a kettle and teapot, but no tea or coffee (even to purchase) despite there being a fully stocked mini bar and snacks. Other thoughtless touches. The owners clearly have no intention to improve upon."

Hội An,Hoi An Heart Villa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",12/03/2019,"Vi har verkligen uppskattat vår tid här hoi an och på magnolia. Det rummet vi valde hade balkong med utsikt mot polen som var perfekt att ta ett morgon dopp i. Magnolia ligger en bit utanför staden men lånar ut cyklar gratis som man kan ta sig runt med. Läget är mycket bra om man vill utforska då det är raka vägen på en gata (ca 2km) till gammal stan och i princip raka vägen på en gata (ca 2km) till stranden, samt en massa annat av restauranger, marknader och dylikt att utforska i närområdet. Området är lugnare än stadskärnan , men fortfarande inte helt dött och man kan få tag på mat å annat fram till runt 22 tiden. Det ingick ingen frukost på detta homestay, men det ligger ett café som erbjuder olika typer av frukost ca 1 minut undan, samt även andra butiker och restauranger, utagsautomat och välbehövliga grejer."

The place is a family run villa and every single person was lovely and you could see them stop what they were doing as soon as you entered to greet you. I even came in quite late most nights and had to ring a bell and not an issue or a moan. The breakfast was also lovely and very personal where they take your order the previous night. Room was cleaned every day and i felt very welcome staying here. The only thing i didn t like about the villa was the location at night, it would be absolutely fine if i wasnt a solo traveller though. Its only a 4 minute walk but it s through more of a residential area and it was a bit eerie. There was also 4 dogs who lived in a house near by who would be out on the path at night which was a little intimidating. I would stay again and would just ensure i got a grab back instead. Would just like to add i had no issues what so ever was just how i felt on my own."

Great room, great breakfast, service of high quality, all staff very attentive and responsive to my questions and comments. Great laundry service as well. The property is very family friendly. They have courses like cooking and pottery, plus they can arrange day trips to various sights. It is not brand new and it has a few condition issues regarding lighting in stairs at night and other minor issues which i raised and staff duly took note of. I have stayed at far more expensive places that provided neither the service, nor the overall quality of experience hoi an historic hotel does. It s one of the best values for money i ve ever had in more than two decades of my tourism and business travel worldwide.

Hội An,Hoi An Historic Hotel,Traveloka,Stephen,"10,0",01/06/2025,"What a fabulous hotel and staff! the service is the best i have ever seen and i am 73 years old and have travelled extensively. The rooms are big and spacious and are cleaned every day. They have a pool, and a spa where i got the best massage ever from a young woman who was fantastic two days in a row. They have a breakfast that is the best i have seen. Eggs made to order, breads, fruits, hot entrees and it s buffet style all you can eat. The town of hoi an is right there and very walkable with a million shops and restaurants. The food everywhere is phenomenal. I highly recommend this !"

Hội An,Hoi An Historic Hotel,Traveloka,Josephus,"10,0",25/08/2025,"This old ol style hotel is modernised, has a lovely old style charm and ambience of a resort. Our room (king suite) overlooked the pool area.p and the interior had lovely floorboards. The breakfast buffet was the best we have had in vietnam and even offered vietnamese coffee where you could make your own iced coffee with condensed milk and ice supplied. A change not to see americano coffee on offer which is substandard. I really enjoyed the banana crepes they made. The grounds are also lovely and the gift shop has a few things to offer. Being only a 5 minute walk to the ancient town made this an ideal location."

Hội An,Hoi An Historic Hotel,GoogleMap,Min,"8,0",11/08/2025,"A beautiful hotel in a highly convenient location within walking distances to the historic quarter. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast area is really pleasant and so is the pool area. Our room was spacious and comfortable but i had issues with the bathroom. I think the hotel could benefit from an update in their bathrooms. The hand towel rail was installed in an awkward place and it had also fallen off within minutes of me using the wash basin. There was no shaving mirror even though i can see holes in the wall for it that has been filled in. One could have existed previously. The height and tilt of the shower cannot be adjusted and so water was spraying over my head to the back of the bath tub which then run down the side and flood the bathroom floor. I had to make several complaints to the reception before something was actually done. The maintenance man came and had the cheek to tell me that i have to hold the shower head to wash! eventually, a gadget was installed on the shower head which enabled the tilt of the shower to be adjusted. Apart from that, we had a lovely stay."

Hội An,Hoi An Historic Hotel,GoogleMap,Eireen,"8,0",12/08/2025,"Vi hadde et fint opphold på hoi an historic! hotellet ligger fint til med kort ganavstand til gamlebyen. Hotellområdet er stort og fint, og maten er helt ok. Vi merket at prisene i cafeen ved bassenget er mye dyrere enn restauranten ved inngangen til hotellet. Det er greit å væe obs på. Rens av klær var også mye dyrere på dette hotellet enn de andre hotellene vi bodde på i thailand. Betjeningen i resepsjonen er veldig hyggelige, og det samme med renholdere/vaktmestere vi møtte på vår vei. Leire-kurset er også verdt å være med på!(gratis aktivitet arrangert av hotellet). Renholdet på hotellet var også bra. Bassenget var alt for varmt, men hver dag kl 12 kom det en bil med enorme isblokker som ble senket i vannet for å få ned temperaturen. Hotellet ligger et stykke fra stranden. Man kan låne håndkler fra hotellet til å bruke på stranden. Ingen sjuttlebuss fra hotell til strand, men det koster ikke mye med en grab."

Plenty to choose from including an egg station, lots of fresh fruits and asian options. There is a lovely pool with lots of sun beds but the weather was too cool during our stay and we didn t make use of it. The only negative for us was that we were given a pool view room right above the pool bar/ restaurant that is open until 11 pm. We had been up since 4 am due to our flight in and desperately wanted an early night but a bus tour group were partying loudly at the bar. We asked for a room change and fortunately they were able to move us. There are plenty of tailors on the street if you would like to get a suit, dress, etc. Made, takes just 2-3 days depending what you order."

B.,"6,1",07/06/2019,"Phòng ở đây như phòng của nhà nghỉ (thiết kế như nhà trọ sinh viên), không tương xứng với tên gọi villa thua xa vài nơi cùng giá tiền tôi từng ở cũng ở hội an. Tường bị bong, đồ trong phòng khá cũ, thiết bị phòng vệ sinh ố vàng và cũng cũ. Đồ dùng cá nhân trong phòng (bàn chải, kem đánh răng, khăn tắm) là đồ của nhà nghỉ. Khăn tắm ố bẩn, và nặng mùi thuốc tẩy. Dù sau đó được đổi nhưng cũng không khá hơn. Trong phòng không có ấm nấu nước, cũng chẳng có ly uống nước. Trong phòng rất nặng mùi thuốc tẩy, có lẽ bốc lên từ chăn gối và ga giường. Bù lại, chỉ có hồ bơi là vớt vát lại được chút cảm tình. Hồ nhỏ, nhưng sạch, bên cạnh có khu ngồi ăn uống ngắm cảnh. Chủ nhà cũng vui vẻ."

Hội An,Hoi An Majestic Villa,Traveloka,Constantinos,"6,0",21/01/2019,"We didn t sleep well here, as the bed was not too comfortable, and the room was rather small. The location is really near the night market and the city center, and the staff even offered to deliver us from our previous hotel, so they were very helpful. We didn t find the breakfast appetizing enough to try it. Also the door is locked after a certain hour, and one needs to ring the bell to get in. The swimming pool looks like an afterthought, i cannot imagine anyone relaxing there. There is a lot of construction in the area too, that woke us up rather early (as did the rooster, but i don t mind that)."

Hội An,Hoi An Reverie Villas,Traveloka,Ngan Truong,"5,4",16/09/2017,"Tôi đã dành kỳ nghỉ của tôi ở đây vào ngày 1 tháng tất cả mọi thứ đã không nhìn tốt với mong đợi của tôi. Khách sạn đã được vận hành trong một vài tuần nên dịch vụ khá tệ. Rất xa phố cổ hội an, chúng tôi mất 10 phút để di chuyển bằng taxi, chi phí khoảng 60k / chiều. Đường bị thu hẹp, rất bẩn khi đi xe máy hoặc xe đạp bể bơi quá sâu để trẻ em bơi vào. Tôi ở trong căn hộ gia đình 32 mét vuông, phòng thiết kế rất rộng và đẹp. Nhưng điều hòa không đủ để làm mát căn phòng. Quá nóng để ngủ ngon mặc dù tôi bật thêm quạt. 5 bữa sáng rất nghèo. Chúng tôi hy vọng có một bữa tiệc buffet cho bữa sáng là cách rất phổ biến khi bạn ở khách sạn. Nhưng ở đây, họ không có đội ngũ bếp để nấu ăn, họ chỉ gọi đồ ăn bên ngoài (mỗi người một món) và không hâm nóng trước khi phục vụ chúng tôi. Khá thất vọng về điểm này. Do vị trí của chúng ở phía đất nước, có quá nhiều muỗi bay xung quanh. Khiến chúng tôi bực mình. Chỉ có ấn tượng tốt là nhân viên tiếp tân. Cô ấy khá tốt bụng và ủng hộ chúng tôi. Tóm lại, với những cơ sở, dịch vụ, địa điểm và giá cả. Chúng tôi có nhiều lựa chọn hơn để chọn phố cổ hội an gần đó."

Nhược điểm khăn trải giường thô và khăn trải giường. Điều này thực sự cần phải được cải thiện. Phòng tắm được thiết kế không thông minh trong phòng chúng tôi ở lại (103b hệ thống đèn quá sáng không thoải mái làm bật cả căn phòng vào ban đêm, 203b vị trí xấu của vòi hoa sen khiến cho phòng tắm ướt mỗi khi sử dụng, bồn tắm thoát nước rò rỉ, - không cửa đóng cửa (?!)) khóa cửa không an toàn và không an toàn. Không thể bật / tắt đèn ban công / sân trong các phòng nhưng hệ thống của tòa nhà sẽ được bật lên (?!) ghế hoặc ghế dài được đề nghị trước các phòng nhìn ra sân vườn / sân vườn ở tầng trệt. Hạn chế sự lựa chọn và thậm chí không ngon ăn sáng. Đặc biệt là chuối chuối bánh. Nhân viên cần được đào tạo bài bản để làm việc chuyên nghiệp và mang lại cảm giác tốt hơn."

Tôi và bạn tôi ở đây 2 đêm chỉ dùng 2 chai nước suối, vậy mà lúc trả phòng xuất hiện đâu ra chai nước ngọt đã uống dỡ trong tủ lạnh, tôi cũng lười tranh cãi nên tính tiền luôn. Chưa kể villa tự ý cho người vào dọn dẹp phòng khi tôi không có ở đó, tuy biết là villa có ý tốt nhưng thật sự không hài lòng."

Không gian thoáng sạch sẽ, có con chó ngao hay gì đó to đùng canh cửa.

Vị trí ko ở ngay trung tâm nhg đi vào trung tâm hội an chỉ khoảng 10 , gần làng gốm thanh hà và sông nên khá yên tĩnh, gần đó còn có chợ. Villa tương đối nhỏ nên ko dễ nhận ra nếu mới đến, mọi người có thể hỏi ng dân xung quanh đó, ngay khúc cua giao với đường hùng vương. Phòng ốc rất rộng rãi và sạch sẽ, phòng như mình ở còn có balcony với bộ bàn ghế uống trà, bồn tắm đá giữ nhiệt. Trang thiết bị rất mới và hoạt động tốt, ko có gì để phàn nàn. Nhân viên tương đối nhiệt tinh. Điểm trừ là đồ ăn sáng còn hạn chế và ko vừa miệng lắm, có thể vì tổng số phòng ko nhiều nên họ chỉ làm vừa vặn đồ ăn sáng chứ ko làm nhiều như các khách sạn lớn. Bể bơi khá bé nhưng mình chỉ ở 1 đêm nên cũng ko yêu cầu gì quá cao. Recommend nếu mọi người đã chán ở những khách sạn trong trung tâm ồn ào và muốn nghỉ dưỡng với bầu không khí yên tĩnh trong lành"

Còn có hồ cá đẹp và 1 chú husky, nhưng có 1 vài điều khiến tôi không đánh giá cao tôi đặt phòng trước ngày tôi đến là 3 ngày nhưng không có cuộc điện thoại xác nhận tôi đặt phòng địa chỉ villa không rõ ràng, đến nơi nhưng tôi vẫn không biết đó là aquarium villa không có người hỗ trợ mang hành lý lên phòng có 1 cô lễ tân không nhiệt tình, không tâm lý gì cả, vừa nhận chìa khòa phòng xong là cô ấy nói đặt món ăn sáng cho ngày mai để chuẩn bị, dù gì cũng phải đợi khách lên phòng nghỉ ngơi điểm tâm thật sự rất tệ, mua ở bên ngoài mang vô, không nói ngon hay dở, điều nói đến là nó mất đi sự sang trọng mang tên villa"
Hội An,Hoi An Reverie Villas,Traveloka,Nguyen N. H.,"9,4",08/06/2018,"Chỉ mất 5p đi xe máy vào trung tâm phố cổ. Hồ bơi đẹp. Nhân viên thân thiện.

Hội An,Hoi An Reverie Villas,Traveloka,Nguyen H. D.,"9,6",06/06/2018,"Thực sự ưng ý với aquarium. Cách phố cổ khoảng 1km nên rất tiện di chuyển. Cung đường dẫn tới phố cổ rộng, thoáng và đặc biệt đẹp. Khuôn viên villa rộng, thoáng và đẹp. Bể bơi sạch, không quá nhỏ. Phòng ốc sạch sẽ và tạo cảm giác thư thái. Nói chung mình vô cùng happy với trải nghiệm tại aquarium (nhà tắm đẹp và sang trọng). Điểm trừ là khuôn viên nhiều ruồi, đặc biệt là lúc ăn sáng. Đồ ăn không đặc sắc, cần bổ sung thêm nhiều món và món súp cần nấu đặc hơn. Nếu quay lại hội an chắc chắn sẽ lưu trú ở đây lần nữa"

Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",02/11/2018,"The resort is in desperate need of some tlc but i think this is reflected in the price you pay. Breakfast is great as long as you arrive by 7, otherwise the food stays for 3 hours and taking a late breakfast is not an option as everything is covered in flies. I arrived 9 45 one day and they had already packed up for true day. Coffee was available though i took an evening trip to the marble mountains and was very angry to spend the first hour of the tour at a shop where owners were aggressively trying to sell you wares. They tried to fob me off with it s a charity weekend but that was not the case, the charity market came later. I subsequently cancelled the following trip, i love buying the nick jacks on offer but this was truly something ekse and made me feel vulnerable. I took some room service the evening before departure and had to send the vanilla ice cream back because it was green. Next thing i know the resauant manager has been called in from his fathers funeral!!!!! to deal with the drama. The poor man was heart broken and i was livid that for the sake of 80 pence the man had been distressed so much. Finally when i came to check out, there were extra charges on my bill for spa treatments that i had already paid in cash directly to the spa, but honestly couldn t be arsed with the battle given the previous evenings debacle so i paid the extra 8. Just about to leave and the receptionist starts going mad about a cup, said i had stolen it but it had been on rs tray!"

But i think the rooms are old and were renovated, we noticed the difference on each part of the room, its like two small rooms joined together. Free shuttle servce to hoi an town but you have to be there on schedule. I just wish they have a free ride to the beach, although it s just a 5 minutes walk, but considering the weather (it was 35 degrees celsius when we were there) it would be hard if you have a child with you. The breakfast is great, a lot of choices. Staff are very friendly and always smiling. We would love to come back!"
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",09/07/2014,We loved this hotel.

One day we borrowed the hotel bicycles and road into the ancient town. Great place
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",12/07/2014,"Hotel was a nice staff, free bicycles were great and the breakfast was nice.

Det beste av alt var servicen, særlig i restauranten. Personalet var alltid imøtekommende og hyggelige, særlig q. Toan som alltid passet godt på gjestene. Maten i restauranten og baren var meget, meget bra og frokosten hadde stort utvalg med frisk frukt, asiatisk og vestlig mat.

Hotel within easy walking distance to the local beach but unfortunately a lot of this beach had been washed away with recent storms. Swimming pool small and not very inviting as it looked green most of the time.

Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,kenya,"6,0",25/09/2014,The hotel was filled with noisey kids so early in the morning. They were slamming doors and always making noise in the pool. Also the beds were very sandy too. The bathroom is also outdated. But the free shuttle to hoi an ancient town was useful and they offered few bicycle rentals. They also had a discounted shuttle to the airport which was good.
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"4,0",18/10/2018,Resort is lacking in amenities. Areas of resort needed cleaning.

Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Andrew,"8,0",28/08/2018,The river beach is a few minutes walk from the beach but once inside the hotel it s very peaceful. The hotel could do with some renovation to make it a bit more modern and the pool area needs a fix up. Wifi was really poor. Don t expect to come here and stream anything (you can barely get emails)! other than that you want to relax around the pool or go to the beach it s ideal.
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,GoogleMap,Shar,"8,0",11/06/2016,"For the amount you pay for this hotel, it s excellent value for money. Don t expect chocolates on the pillow but you will find it tidy and the staff are really nice.

Im alten teil sind die superior zimmer untergebracht, die für den preis völlig in ordnung sind, jedoch alt und renovierungsbedürftig und haben auch keinen blick in den neuen bereich der anlage (bei der buchung war dies irreführend). Der neue bereich beherbergt die lobby, restaurant (in dem auch das frühstück serviert wird), die schöne poolanlage und viele schöne liegebereiche und die außenbar.

Wobei zu erwähnen ist, dass das hotelrestaurant, verglichen mit westlichen preisen ebenfalls günstig ist. Nach hoi an bietet das hotel einen kostenfreien shuttle an.

Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,jeanni,"4,0",10/05/2016,"Olde worlde charm. Main building has french colonial influence, my room was in another building away from the main. Entry hall smelt dank and musty. First room faced the road, at a t junction. Sleep was impossible due to traffic s habit of beeping horn to warn other road users of their approach. Requested move to another room, facing river. Much quieter and bigger. Was a little alarmed to see vanity had huge crack in it, inexpertly repaired with silicone, and tile grout was mouldy. Could not connect to wifi despite sitting under wifi router. Had to call desk to get aircon fixed as i could not reach it to adjust it or turn it off and the hand set was not working. As the air con was fixed high up on the wall, the janitor had to use a long pole to turn it off. I had two choices freeze with the air con on, swelter with it off. Final straw was when i ventured out through french doors to balcony and discovered half the hotel appeared not to have a roof. Hoarding had been put up on poolside of building so that this lack was not obvious to pool users or breakfast eaters. I stayed one night, then moved out. Can i please have my money back?"
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Paul,"8,0",04/05/2016,A good hotel with a nice location although you do have to make sure you re in the main block not the annex (no wi-fi and lower standard rooms). The grounds are lovely and the views along the river excellent. They offer a shuttle into hoi an which takes about 10/15 minutes and free bikes. The beach that was once 100 yards away has now been eroded by the wave and so you do need to go about 2 miles north where there are great beaches - that s where the bikes come in.
Hội An,Hoi An River Beach Resort and Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"2,0",27/04/2016,"What do you expect when you book a superior room and it is written room with view and the name of the hotel is river beach hotel? a room with view on the river, instead interesting enough i got a room with street view. I was not able to sleep at all, the street was very noisy with a lot of traffics and cocks, yes cocks. Wifi was not working in the area of the hotel where i was and i needed to wait the day after and the arrival of the manager to talk and have a new room. I spent more than 30 minutes to explain my concern and they were not properly reacting on my complaints. So future bookers, pay attention to what you are booking."

Hotellet är lugnt, personalen vänlig, bra mat i restaurangen och stora bekväma familjerum. Poolen var härlig och bjöd på många svalkande dopp. Enda minuset för hotellet är att det är väldigt lyhört. Detta märkte vi först efter några nätter då vi fått grannar vägg i vägg. Minuset för området är att stranden som ligger intill är helt fördärvad av erosion. Inget bad i havet här alltså.

Hội An,Hoi An Riverside Villas & Apartments,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",16/01/2020,"I stayed here before in march and despite my room being double booked the manager made suitable arrangements for me. I arrived again on 19 dec 2019 and what was apparent was there was a lack of leadership. There was no obvious capable person in charge and english speaking was quite poor. For the first two days, i advised reception 4 times about their being no hot water and no water pressure for my family to shower in comfort. Of course the staff were apologetic and kept telling me 5 minutes , 5 minutes . It was hours until the problem was resolved on the first day and then we had the same problem the next day. When i came to check out there was confusion over my expedia booking and staff were having a problem recognising my booking number. They got there in the end. On the dry days the cushions weren t put out in the sun loungers by the pool attendant. The exteria of the building needs some wood treatment and is looking a bit tired. The breakfast staff were the same as before and the breakfast was adequate. I write this review because i fear that if the owner does not appoint an efficient and capable manager quickly who knows about the complete running of a hotel business, then i cannot see the villa/hotel giving a good return on investment. There won t be the repeat customers and a few bad reviews will be damaging. The young vietnamese woman on the desk some days was very sweet and pleasant.

Hội An,Hoi An Riverside Villas & Apartments,Traveloka,Liane,"6,0",20/04/2018,"Had a good 3 day stay at the river palms. Staff are a bit shy because their english isnt so good so are probably abit gun shy but if you make the effort they are a great group that tries hard to please. Its a smaller hotel so choice for breakfast is limited but we never had a problem with freshness or ample variety. Easy walking distance to ancient town. Beware of traffic on this main road can be overwhelming starting early in the morning. Also the roosters next door start early at about 4 am and they put their dog out in the middle of the night every night and he barks incessently for over an hour. I actually felt sorry for the poor thing. None of this is the hotels fault but it is worth noting if you are looking for peace and quiet. The hotel and grounds are kept very clean and rooms are ample size. The rooms could use a box of tissues, the tub is not anchored down so you have to be extremely careful you dont tip the whole thing over if you get in. I think someone must have grabbed for their life as the towel rack is hanging pulled out of the wall and so towels are always placed on the bed. Lighting could use a bit more intensity in the bathroom - fairly dark in there."

This hotel is further towards the expensive side when staying here, but is well worth the additional spend. The service from every member of staff is fantastic, from the moment you step through the door you are welcomed and taken through every detail of your stay, every member of the team makes an effort to interact and make conversation with you. The facilities in the hotel are great, we were upgraded into a suite on arrival, which was extremely spacious and done to a very high standard. The hotel also has a good gym and pool, as well as useful shuttle busses into the tow and beach (although the town is only a 10 minute walk if you need to stretch your legs). We extended our stay for an additional 2 days, which was made easy by the team, who were able to keep us in the same room for our convenience at short notice.

Cons they are lack of capacity to maintain many guests. I had to wait for breakfast because their restaurant is too small to ocupyy many guest. Worst part is while i m waiting the staff let some western guest go in without asking any waiting guests before them. Seems they have different rule for westerns. They provide free shuttle to old town, however, there is chance that you cannot get in a bus. It is first come first served according to the staff. Which means even though you waited from old town to the hotel, nobody gurantee your ride. Lastly, they had blackout, and they never informed guest until the day. Thus in the morning we knew that whole town is blackout. Some hotel actually managed to provided electricity using power generator, but this hotel s generator was broken, so they failed to provide it. If i know that there is blackout, i should haven t stay there."

The hotel next door called anio is newer and nicer. They offer a shuttle service into the main town which is great but it is often full and you have to wait a while for another one. We ended using the anio shuttle many times. The hotel itself is old and a little dirty in places. The food is not the greatest. Overall it s an ok hotel. The staff are all very pleasant though.

We stayed in a room with an outdoor bathroom and loved it - something we haven t experienced before and quite cool! the bath in particular was fantastic, a great spot to relax after a day of exploring. We also liked that this is quite a small hotel (more of a villa - as the name suggests) so had a more personal feel. Great spot to stay!"

Hội An,Hoi An Sunny Pool Villa,GoogleMap,Megat,"8,0",16/03/2018,"This is a nice homestay close to the ancient town of hoi an. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Bicycles are free to use for guests but limited in number and some of them could do with a little maintenance (brakes could work better). The breakfast selection is good with a variety of dishes to choose from and is made with fresh ingredients purchased that same morning. The only issue i encountered was the number of flies in the dining area which made it quite uncomfortable to eat. They should perhaps consider purchasing a trap or a zapper. Apart from that though, i enjoyed my stay at sunny pool. The location was good, staff were excellent, and the pool does indeed catch the sun all day! it s also worth noting that the wifi is excellent throughout the property."

I was concerned about checking in late in the evening, but it was good that the host waited and explained the warm tea to me kindly. It was white and clean (no bugs) accommodation, kindness, a pretty swimming pool, and delicious breakfast (it was the most delicious bread of all time in vietnam!) i was so happy to get an incredible price. I wanted to stay more, but i was sorry that i had a schedule and i would like to stay here if i could travel again next time. I have traveled a lot, but it was the first time that the host was kind and attentive to guests and good service. Best !!!"

Đến hội an rồi còn mắc công đi tìm phòng nên mình đồng ý. Phòng mình ở tầng 4, lúc mình đi chơi tầm 3h chiều xuống cầu thang thì thấy 2-3 phòng khác không có khách ở, rộng hơn.

Đầu tiên, nhân viên của khách sạn không chỉ chào đón mà cô ấy còn cung cấp cho tôi thông tin giá trị vì sự an toàn của khách hàng, điều đó thể hiện sự quan tâm của khách sạn đối với khách hàng. Nó làm cho chúng tôi đánh giá rất cao. Đối với vị trí, theo quan điểm của tôi, tôi nghĩ rằng nó khá xa làng cổ, trung tâm của chuyến thăm ở hội an nếu nó ở trong một khoảng cách đi bộ. Bên cạnh đó, phòng và tổng diện tích trong khách sạn được trang trí độc đáo. Chúng tôi cảm thấy rất ấn tượng với bữa sáng của mình rằng chúng rất ngon và đa dạng. Thật đáng tiếc, một trong những cơ sở của nó là những chiếc xe đạp được phục vụ miễn phí, đáp ứng sự tưởng nhớ tốt đẹp của cha tôi ở hội an."

Gọi chủ nhà thì ừ à cho có xong bọn mh đi chơi tới muộn về vẫn không xử lý được mà cũng không nói rõ được là khi nào sẽ có. Cuối cùng cả nhóm 8 ng phải sang hàng xóm tắm nhờ vì quá muộn rồi. Chưa hết bất ổn khi phòng người lớn nhà mình đang ngủ thì tự nhiên cửa kính phòng tắm ( ngay cạnh giường ngủ) vỡ tan ra sụp xuống kính bắn vào chảy máu tay và bụng chú mình. Cứ nghĩ vô tình 1 phòng bị thôi nhưng cơ sở vật chất nhà này cực kém vì phòng mình cửa kính tắm cũng nứt, phòng em trai mình nằm thì trần nhà có lỗ nước nhỏ xuống liên tục, gạt nước vòi hoa sen của nhà tắm cũng bung ra!!! mình không định đánh giá xấu vì thấy vụ mất nước cũng là do ngta không mong muốn. Nhưng cách hành xử của chủ nhà không khéo! chai nước khoáng loại 500ml để trong phòng tính tiền 10k 1 chai không đáng là bao. Bọn mình ở mất nước nên lấy tạm nước đó đánh răng hôm sau anh ấy vẫn thu tiền như thường mặc dù bọn mh đã nói rõ tụi em lấy đánh răng, mình cũng móc tiền ra trả luôn khỏi tranh luận mất thời gian )) bình nước lọc miễn phí không phải nước đóng chai mà là loại bình nước tự rót vào rồi đậy nắp nên quá nhiều người dùng chung không an toàn vệ sinh!

Hội An,Hoiana Residences,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",05/09/2024,"My husband and i, along with our two children (7 and nearly 2) stayed here for 6 nights. We booked 2 rooms, but one of the rooms was smaller than the other, so the information provided wasn t entirely accurate. We had booked our stay well in advance and had requested a room on a higher floor to avoid mosquitoes. Unfortunately, when we arrived, they only had two rooms left, both on the second floor, which was disappointing. The receptionist assured us there wouldn t be any mosquitoes on the second floor. However, as soon as we entered the room, we could smell mosquito spray, which we recognized from frequent use during our trips in asia. Within the first hour in the room, both my daughter and i were bitten by mosquitoes. Throughout our stay, i killed several mosquitoes in our room every single day. But given that no other rooms were available, we made the best of the situation. A big plus for the hotel is that they have their own healthcare staff, which is very reassuring. Another highlight was the breakfast buffet at aroma restaurant great atmosphere, a wide selection of food and drinks, and an overall fantastic restaurant. I want to especially thank kim chi and nghi for their excellent service at aroma. Both were very thoughtful and took great car"

Hội An,Homestay Bãi Hương,Traveloka,mark,"2,0",28/09/2015,"Overall really bad experience. Real safety questions that go to whether this place should be listed. The snorkel tour equipment was substandard (and there were no fins) and the owner was i believe inebriated in the tiny wood boat. Two other young women tried to get back into the boat but the owner was sleeping and the rope ladder broke. Extremely unsafe. Our room had no door on it and the owner and his wife were constantly coming in. My girlfriend was without clothes and the male owner came in and stared at her grinning until she yelled at him. The home stay was misrepresented in description. Basically, the descriptions are for an amalgamation of various home stays in this village. There is no balcony. The tv is also on loud. The electricity goes off at 10 pm in the village. There is a wonderful little buddhist monastery in the village worth going to and speaking with the young monk. I did not expect even a two star place and was not expecting it. I have traveled in many third world countries - that is not the issue. The issue is safety and security. We booked for two nights but left after one night. Depending on how you get to the islands a number of the boats are unsafe."

Hội An,Homestay Bãi Hương,Traveloka,Florian,"10,0",17/07/2016,"Dear fellow travellers, we spent two nights at island smiles homestay and i have to say it was the best decision we have made while travelling viet nam. Everything was incredibly well organised. Kim, the owner, contacted us two days before our arrival and she speaks very good english so it was very easy to communicate. Her mom, bui, came to pick us up at the main ferry arrival in bai lang. Then we took a second boat to bai huong with bui to go to the homestay. We were delighted to be there. The house is very clean and new as well as the sheets, the bathroom is functional, and most important the food bui cooked for us was incredibly delicious! we really enjoyed ourself at this homestay, we felt at home. Bui is such a loving person, she took care of us very very well. I would like to thank you kim and bui (also called mama kim ) for being so helpful during our stay on beautiful cham island. Lastly, i would recommend this homestay to everyone who is willing to learn about the real vietnamese culture and lifestyle. Cheers, zoe and florian"
Hội An,Homestay Bãi Hương,Traveloka,Carine,"6,0",03/09/2017,"I had been in contact with homestay bai huong prior to our arrival to advise them that we were making our own way to cham island with a diving company. I asked them if they could pick us up from the beach where the diving company was going to leave us. They confirmed all was ok and they would come and get us. Once at the beach, we waited for over an hour but no one turned up. Despite the language barrier, we managed to arrange a lift by boat with a local vietnamese man. When we arrived at the village, a man confirmed he had received our email but he was not the owner of the place i had booked. I believe there was some confusion there and i might have emailed the wrong person. He took us to a place which was very basic and was not the place i had originally booked. I refused to stay there. So he found us another place to stay which belonged to the parents of the lady i had booked with. It still wasn t the place i had booked, as she (kim) had given our rooms to someone else but it was clean, had air conditioning and the couple were doing their outmost to please us. In the end, we were happy with the accommodation. Mama kim took great care of us, cooked us some wonderful food and was genuinely friendly and helpful, despite the language barrier.

Hội An,Homestay Charming,Traveloka,Maria,"10,0",24/11/2023,"We loved charming homestay in hoi an. The owner and hostess nhi, is a true gift to travelers. Among the many, many helpful things she did for us she arranged for car transfer from the airport to hoi an, which was very reasonably priced. She went out of her way to help us get the most out of our few days there, recommending various activities, restaurants, even a fantastic cirque du soleil inspired show with music, dance and acrobatics which was great! she gave us maps with directions to wonderful out of the way but beautiful locales eg an idyllic, beautiful open air restaurant where we enjoyed the serenity of the rice fields while having delicious drinks like iced coconut coffee. She also directed us to a likely equally great locales at the beach, but we never got to ride bikes (which she provides) out there due to monsoonal weather. If it wasn t for nhi we would have missed the wonderful cirque du soleil inspired show because we got caught in a monsoon rain, but she called a cab and then when he picked us up she gave him instructions to drop us off at the theater door. We got there in the nick of time! regarding the homestay room it was wonderful! large, airy, bright, with a balcony and garden view. Quiet, very private, and very clean, with a large very good shower. The king bed and pillows had nice linens the bed was very comfortable. A/c worked great. We slept very well. Nhi made us a delicious breakfast every day. We highly recommend charming homestay!"

The location is a 10 minute bike ride from downtown but we didn t mind at all because the homestay had bikes for use for free and motorbike for us 5. The location was also close to several food and coffee shops making it convenient. The owners were helpful and really nice. On the last day our night train wasn t until 10pm, and even tho checkout was 12pm, they let us leave our bags in their living room and take their bikes out until whenever we wanted. She even let us use her showers before leaving so we can be clean and refreshed for our overnight train! that was definitely a lifesaver. Great place overall! would stay again!"

Hội An,Hội An Bali Homestay,GoogleMap,András,"4,0",27/01/2024,"We arrived after a period of 2 weeks of continuous raining. Because of this, our room was extremely humid. This meant that even sitting on top of the bed made our clothes a bit wet and out towels could not dry even after a full day. We asked the host to change our bed sheets but it did not make a difference. They offered us to change a room but the other option was extremely humid as well. Sadly the lack of anti humidifyer made the situation unbearable to us so we had to check out and move to a different hotel. Such a pity because the staff was very helpful and understanding, but our comfort and health was more important this time. Maybe during better weather conditions we would have had a great stay but it was not the case this time. We would not reccomend to others to stay here after our experience."

One trip, due to misunderstanding, the driver could not get to our desired location as previously agreed, the hotel provided partial refund for that trip. The pool was great, my kids spent a lot of time there each day. Cooked breakfast each day, yummy and plentiful. We used taxi to old town and an bang beach. The hotel called a taxi or we walked to the main road and hailed one. The taxi ride was small cost. Hotel supply bicycles but we didn t use in our trip. Overall, it is great hotel with great value."

The pictures online are completely misleading the place is old, poorly maintained, and far from what was advertised. The pool was dirty, and the pump never seemed to be working. Our room was in terrible condition we found a massive spider (about 20 cm in diameter) inside. The shower was completely blocked, causing the entire bathroom to flood. The room had a terrible, unbearable smell. To make things worse, the reception experience was extremely uncomfortable. The receptionist constantly asked intrusive questions every day where are you going? what did you do yesterday? when are you leaving? it felt more like an interrogation than a warm welcome, making our stay even more unpleasant. Overall, this was the worst experience we had in hoi an. The hotel is outdated, dirty, and has terrible service. I would not recommend staying here."

Auch wenn es einige punkte gibt die verbesserungswürdig sind (staub auf den ablagen, kein safe-wahrscheinlich auch nicht nötig, fahrräder vorhanden aber nicht verkehrssicher, dusche heiß kalt einstellung schwierig) empfehlen wir die unterkunft guten gewissens weiter und bedanken uns für einen schönen aufenthalt."
Hội An,Hội An Rustic Villa,Traveloka,Alexander,"10,0",20/10/2024,"Sensationelles durch eine familie geführtes hotel. Ich war schon auf der welt in vielen hotels aber dieses zählt zu einem der schönsten hotels wo ich bisher war. Aus meiner sicht noch mindestens einen stern mehr verdient. Es liegt zwar etwas außerhalb aber dank der kostenlosen fahrräder ist der strand oder auch die altstadt von hoi an in 15-20 minuten super zu erreichen oder man nimmt ein grab für 2-4 eur. Die zimmer sind riesig, sauber und schön und alles was man braucht ist vorhanden. Hervorzuheben ist die freundlichkeit der familie die dort alles selbst macht und das frühstück man bekommt jeden tag frisches obst und auch selbstgemachte marmelade mit früchten aus dem eigenen garten. Zudem wird das frühstück für jeden gast frisch zubereitet es gab auch immer die leckeren banana pancakes. Zu dem konnte man sich jeden tag etwas typisches vietnamesisches aussuchen wie zum beispiel pho oder banh mi. Wir konnten über die unterkunft auch einen privaten fahrer für ausflüge und die fahrt zum flughafen nach da nang buchen zu dem bieten sie einen lundry service nach kilo an der genau den preisen draußen entspricht auch super praktisch. Fazit wer es ruhig, schön und entspannt haben möchte ist hier genau richtig, klein aber fein."

Highlight des homestays sind die wunderbaren gastegeber. Super nett und zuvorkommend. Ich wurde während des aufenthalts krank und man hat sich rührend um mich gekümmert (inklusive ingwer-tee). Das homestay liegt in der mitte zwischen strand und altstadt. Mit den kostenlosen fahrrädern kann man diese problemlos erreichen. Ein gutes und einfaches lokales restaurant ist fußläufig zu erreichen."
Hội An,Hội An Rustic Villa,Traveloka,Marta,"10,0",20/10/2016,"Absolutely loved this place! value for money was incredible. Away from hustle and bustle of hoi an town only few steps away from stunning ricefields but short and simple one road cycle from ancient town. Quality of everything was impecable, flowers on the bed, scent in the air con, amazing jungle shower, towels are better than those we get in hilton. Cleverly designed by use of bamboo that in the heat keeps the room cool even when air con is off! brand new bikes, deliscious made to order/buffet breakfast. Lovely family that will do everything to make your stay pleasant. Make sure you spend some time with them! we were on extended travel trip and this was the best stay we have had for the last 8 months! thank you!"

The staff here are so wonderful and really care about you and your trip. The rooms were large and spotlessly clean. Large bathroom with a huge bathtub and shower. Each room has a balcony area with comfy seats overlooking the koi pond, a nice place to sit and relax. You order breakfast the day before and as soon as you take a seat they bring fresh juice and fruits whilst they cook your breakfast - this was a huge highlight for me! the pool was probably the cleanest pool i ve ever swam in! they light it up so pretty for an evening swim. The staff helped us book local tours, we also had a lovely massage, and they helped us booked taxis. They even waved us off as we left! the local area is so nice - lots of nice restaurants and cafes along the beach - i recommend hit ha and naia (this one is right across the street and they also offer yoga classes overlooking the sea!).

Distance from toilet to shower and vanity was non existent. Cleanliness was satisfactory, pool was excellent and breakfast exceeded are expectations.

Hội An,KOI Resort and Spa Hoi An,Traveloka,Rachel,"8,0",21/02/2023,The staff were lovely and friendly and a nice pool. Great breakfast and lovely touches in the room like special tea and fruit. The beach across the street (not the fault of the property though) was awful... It is eroding and sandbags are placed to try to keep erosion from getting worse. Beach was dirty and lots of glass
Hội An,KOI Resort and Spa Hoi An,Traveloka,Casey,"10,0",24/03/2023,"I love how this property is separated from the parking lot and busy roadway so it is wonderfully quiet and serene. I enjoy walking so i enjoyed walking from our room to the motorbike, but you can take the electric cart if you want. We also used the free bicycles sometimes too, loved it. Beautiful grounds all around the hotel, near the beach. The room was beautiful with a great bathroom and tub. Very few windows though, the room was pretty dark. Check-in was relatively easy. Fantastic service. We are two women friends travelling together as a vacation from living in hanoi. We did get creep vibes from one of the bellhops and tried to avoid him, but no bad vibes from anyone else. I wish they had a water dispenser in the lobby. They give you two tiny 500ml bottles of water per day and i just wish i could fill my water bottle and not use so much plastic. I was told at breakfast i couldn t fill my water bottle with the water dispenser there no takeaway . This place feels exclusive without exclusive prices. Loved it."

Rummet var rent och och personalen var överlag väldigt trevlig. Frukosten var väldigt bra tycker jag och hotel restaurangen är bra men relativt dyrt tycker jag om man jämför priset med andra ställen. Det är lätt att ta sig till cua dai stranden (status 2019, stora delar av cua dai stranden är stängd pga stormskador). Hotellet har en strandremsa som är öppen (2019) och är väldigt trevlig, men litet. Det går att hyra / låna kajak och cykel, men vi gjorde inte det så jag vet into om det kostar något. Men på det stora hela väldigt fint, väldigt lugnt och personalen är väldigt trevlig och väldigt artigt. Det är lätt att ta sig till hoi an old town, taxi funkar bra och vi hade inga problem. Nästan på öret samma belopp hela tiden och det känder riskfritt."

Hội An,KOI Resort and Spa Hoi An,Traveloka,stefan,"8,0",01/04/2025,"Behageligt og flot sted, de har gjort rigtig meget ud af stedet. Skøn udsigt fra værelserne. Fuglekviddere og masser af fisk i vandet. Strand lige over gaden efter at have passeret resortets bro som dog er i virkelig dårlig forfatning. Security mangler at lære at huske deres gæster så man ikke bliver nægtet adgang til resortets indgang (jeg er nem at genkende da jeg sidder i kørestol med motor foran) de lavede en rampe hurtigt indtil vores værelse af nogle træplader så 20 points for det. Værelserne er små, kunne kun lige akkurat komme forbi sengen med min rullestol. Skimmelsvamp på badeværelset i øverste hjørne over badekarret. Strømudtag elendige og intet i nærheden af sengen. Kunne kun bruge det der var på badeværelset."

Location - it s on the river east of town, along a minor road that is mostly cycling and walking. Easy beautiful walk/cycle into town, with restaurants on the river along the way. Place - you have to see this place to believe it. Entire site is covered with flowers and lanterns. People stop to take pictures. It also doubles as a cafe, with 5 different pretty outdoor seating areas. Room - delightfully cosy and unique. Ask for the river view 2nd floor with the great view. Staff - yun is a fabulous host. She s always attentive to your needs. The rest of the staff are great too. Breakfast - included, and they make it personally for you. Other - they have free bikes, an airport shuttle service that saves money. City - hoi an is a must visit in southeast asia. So much to see and do. Beautiful town, especially at night along the river. Definitely see the countryside by bicycle or scooter, and there are beautiful beaches in cycling distance or short taxi ride."

Although it is not a mega-resort like some of those near danang, it has all the needed amenities. Around the hotel there is not a lot available to eat short of the hotel s restaurant. We spent most days at an bang beach or hoi an. The hotel shuttle offer free drop off or pick-up. If you miss the shuttle, it is only a 10 min. Ride to hoi an. The hotel staff were very helpful. Ted and jenna provided suggestions for things to do and places to eat. They also arranged an out-of -this world day tour for us including bamboo boat ride, a private cooking class, my son sanctuary, and an evening ride to hoi an. Ethan, steve, fiona, kevin, and sunny were always helpful, friendly to our children, and they always tried their best to help with our requests.

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & Spa Hoi An Coco River,Traveloka,Steffan,"10,0",04/06/2018,"Både hotellets stand og personalets venlige og hjælpsomme væremåde, gjorde vores ophold på coco river til en sand fornøjelse. Især hvis hotellet har få gæster og de derfor tilbyder a al carte til morgenmaden fremfor buffet er det helt i top. Buffeten mangler lidt nogle ting til at dække maden med da den ellers er fyldt med insekter. Juice og mælken holdes heller ikke ordentlig kold. Poolen har en okay størrelse hvis man ikke er så mange mennesker dernede. Hvis der er store familier bliver den hurtigt fyldt. Shuttlebussen fra hotellet fungere godt men den sidst afgang fra hoi an er en smule tidlig."

The staff from reception, security, restaurant and housekeeping were lovely and provided exceptional service which cannot be faulted. They made us feel great and provided an exceptional level of experience. The hotel itself is a great base and has a great swimming pool area, as well as clean and large rooms and we felt so welcomed and at home, we actually cancelled other accomodation and extended our stay twice because of the experience we had. There were comments prior to going that we read about location, but honestly this wasn t an issue. Yea, it s away from the hustle and bustle, but as a family we were happy to take a 5-10 minute grab to the main touristy parts of hoi an. There is also multiple restaurants/food options, pharmacy, convenience store, coffee shops and motorbike rental within 400m of the resort so was nice to get a respite from the madness of hoi an which can be overwhelming. In saying that, we will be back here and will recommend the hotel to anyone considering hoi an, especially those with younger children as it was perfect for what we needed."

No complains whatsoever about the accommodation as it was more than what we expected. I did however pay extra to have my room upgraded as there was less privacy in our original room. However what made this whole stay a memorable one was due to the fact that their guest relations manager sunny went an extra mile to ensure our needs were well met by arranging for our tours, cars massage etc. I really want to give her a lot of credit for she is great with all her guests and will do everything she can to make their stay a good one.

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & Spa Hoi An Coco River,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",07/02/2019,"The rooms and location are lovely. Simple things that could make the stay more pleasant are better poolside service - beer bottles were left poolside overnight. We often had to request towels at the pool. Despite staff having nothing to do at the restaurant next to the pool no one ever came to see if you wanted any food or drinks. More attentive staff at the restaurant- flys would often be all over the fruit at breakfast and the staff didn t have the initiative to cover the fruit or turn on the fans without prompting. We ate lunch and dinner at the restaurant for a couple of days as we had a sick child. It was disappointing to wait for such a long time for basic food (half an hour for sandwiches). The food was also overpriced and not particularly good. The shuttle is convenient but stops at two other hotels along the way, so allow half an hour to get to the old town this way. Still a comfortable place to stay away from the busy old town and with a few minor improvements it could be an excellent choice."

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & spa Hoi An Ancient House,Traveloka,Tomoko,"8,0",11/10/2024,よりベトナムらしいインテリアと良質のサービスを求めてこの宿を選びました 朝ごはんはベトナム郷土料理と西洋があり フルーツが豊富でとても美味しく 3日滞在したのですが 少しずつメニューも変更されていて毎日飽きませんでした 部屋が1階だったので 部屋の温度と湿度の管理が少し難しかったかもしれません 部屋のバスルームに小さなヤモリが住んでいたのも私にはとても愛らしく感じました 旧市街とビーチには無料でシャトルバスが出ていて(glabでも大した料金ではないですが)安心感もあり 細かなコストをセーブすることもでき とても便利でした 特筆すべきはスタッフのホスピタリティだと思います 出発前から深夜到着のため 送迎の手配をお願いしていましたが 親切に何度もメールをいただいたり 帰りの手配も心配してくれて 夜便のため 荷物を持ったままどのように過ごそうか迷っていたところ タクシーに積んだまま観光し 空港へのお迎えまで完璧に手配してくれました あと宿の中にホテルの名前の由来にもなっている400年前の民家が残っているのですが(ライスペーパーを作ってレストランに卸しているそうです)昔ながらの製法でのライスペーパー作りのワークショップと民家の案内をしてくれました 作りたてのライスペーパー ベトナムの醤油で食べたらとても美味しかった スタッフのミンさん とても親切でした 市街地からは少し距離がありますが(車で5分とか )スーパーが目の前 歩くと食事処もあり 何不自由ない滞在ができました お勧めします

The hotel gardens and grounds are beautifully kept. Our room was stunning, with a lovely outlook. We felt very comfortable and happy with our stay. The hotel shuttle into town was great, although we walked most of the time alone the back street along the river, taking only 15mins. The complimentary bicycles were a lot of fun, we rode through rice fields to tra que vegetable village. It was my second stay here, i liked it so much )"

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & spa Hoi An Ancient House,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"8,0",01/04/2025,"The hotel was lovely, so peaceful and pretty 15 min walk to city centre. You can walk along the river to old hoi an which is peaceful and not so busy. The hotel changed our first room as it didnt have a proper balcony and i just mentioned it in passing and minh got us moved. The reception staff, concierge, housekeeping and minh are very good. Restaurant at breakfast lets the place down. Looks immpressive but feels like it cut corners on quality. Juice isnt freshly squeezed, if the coffee runs put no one notices, the tables aren t relaid if someone leaves so if you.come in a bit later theres no cleaned tables. Choices are limited and same daily, cold meats, salads etc. Doesn t sound much but it just let the hotel down for us. Bikes are a nice touch, worth using."
Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & spa Hoi An Ancient House,Traveloka,shelly,"10,0",16/04/2025,"I used to be a backpacker and now mid-range traveler with my kid. For the cost, i was expecting mid-range but it was luxury. A very stunning place and staff that treat you like royalty. And the breakfast was amazing. There were two areas that affluent folks may not mind, but i was uncomfortable with. There s no card to put on the door to indicate you don t want your towels and bedding changed. It s a waste. And the volume of food at breakfast is glutenous! it s good, but there s so so so much. There doesn t need to be that many choices and that much waste for the wealthy to enjoy themselves."

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & spa Hoi An Ancient House,Traveloka,An,"10,0",18/09/2017,"So glad we picked this ancient house resort! it was really gorgeous. For the price point it was perfect. A very short walking distance to the hoi an lantern town. Recently completely renovated, the rooms are spacious and modern,the layout is lovely with the central pool and lots of trees and greenery against the white building, a very quiet and quite serene atmosphere. The room is beautiful and spotless and the service is delightful. We even got a free upgrade. It is a really tranquil haven after a long day in town. The hotel itself is only a ten minute walk from town. The room also has free internet access and a laptop - a real luxury for vietnamese hotels! fresh fruit is placed in your room each day and at night we come back to find the curtains have been drawn for us and a little traditional dessert is left, along with a note wishing us a good night. The attention to detail is great. We definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"

It s hard to get a sunbed round the pool that s in the sun! if you want a chill day or few hours. We were there a week and we never managed it but if not bothered about the sun then no problem. Wouldn t stop us staying here again though as we d just cycle to the beach ..a must experience.

Hội An,Khu nghỉ dưỡng & spa Hoi An Ancient House,GoogleMap,Allison,"6,0",18/05/2024,Room had a cockroach in it when we came in. The tables were super dusty and had water marks. It also looks like the shower head had quite a bit of black hair dangling from it. The toilet also makes a lot of noise for 10 minutes after you flush so that got really annoying at night. The toilet also isn t separated by a full door so order and any sounds travel throughout the room if you catch my drift. Also didn t have hot water to the room until we called on the 2nd night for some reason. Nothing that s awful but not really worth staying at in my opinion

Hội An,Khách sạn & Spa Hai Au Boutique,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",13/06/2017,"This hotel is in a great location. It takes only a few minutes stroll to be at the market. A 10 minute easy stroll gets you well into the old town. Our room was spacious with a comfy large bed. We had a small balcony with 2 chairs which was a nice place to sit in the evening. The bathroom was clean. It had a shower over the bath. There was also a fridge and safe in the room. The staff were friendly and always waved and said hello when we went in and out. The pool area is well kept. There were a few beds around the pool and some of them had a cushion. The pool went into the shade in the afternoon so it was very nice to sit out by the pool. The hotel also has a bar and restaurant although we didn t use this facility. Breakfast was a buffet and the options were excellent and also some of the options changed daily. There was an egg station, cereals, juices, bread, happy cow cheese, toast, ham, noodles and pho etc."

The hotel location was good being only 5 min walk from the old town, but the room was cramped with too much furniture and the bathroom was smaller than expected. Room was clean though. Staff were helpful but (like many in hoi an) were trying to sell products they were clearly getting commissions on. When we had some clothing delivered from a tailor (not the one they recommended) they were clearly disappointed and a bit annoyed we didn t go with their recommendation. We borrowed bikes from the hotel to get around town, but unfortunately some had unfixable seats (couldn t adjust seat height), poor brakes and needed tires pumped, but they did pump the tires when asked and swapped bikes were weren t comfortable with.

My room had a balcony, but those without have windows overlooking the lovely pool, which looks stunning at night. Breakfast was wide and varied, with plenty of fresh fruit and produce. Turning right out of the hotel, then first left brings you directly to the myriad of streets for shopping, eating, massage and to the old town.

Ac in the shut off when leaving room which was not the ideal but understandable. No ac in hotel lobby or breakfast area. No elevators but staff were happy to carry our bags. They did our laundry for 30k per kilo but mixed up the bag labels so my stuff was labeled under a different room so just be cautious. They have free bicycles but i didn t rent so i don t know about the quality. I rented scooters from the lady down the adjacent alley who also hase laundry services. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to ancient town. My family was very dissatisfied with the breakfast quality and service. On both days i stayed the staff was never ready for the 6 30 breakfast start time. When i came down to the lobby at 6 20 i saw the staff sleeping in the lobby in their pajamas. They had about 30 of breakfast ready by 6 45, bread, stale pastries, hard boiled eggs, fruit, etc. Very frustrating when you try to plan your day around an early start or if you have a shuttle driver waiting which we did. No apology from staff and it seemed normal. To me it seems like a pretty pathetic or lazy attempt for a place that calls themselves a boutique . Good thing there is fantastic banh mi close by at banh mi phuong."

The team asked us what we wanted to do in hoi an and made suggestions of tours and retailers we might try, but didn t press us to make a decision.... I might add all their recommendations were spot on and authentic - especially the cooking class we signed up for. The hotel itself is well located, just a 10 to 15min walk to old town. The hotel is clean, has good wifi, has yummy breakfast options - local and european food choices. Also, they have free bicycles for guest use - we rode out to the beach one morning (about 6km away). All the staff are so friendly, they had a big christmas celebration when we where there and guests could pose with staff and a local santa. The hotel also gave us a complimentary cake to celebrate our honeymoon... A very nice touch. Thanks to tina and the team for a lovely stay. Looking forward to coming back in the future to stay!"

The pool area was also very nice. It had comfortable seats, a pool bar with a good happy hour, and an overall very comfortable vibrant atmosphere. Th breakfast each day was also delicious and complimentary. The staff here was also fantastic. They were very helpful with suggestions, your setups, and transportation. They had our flight information so when our flight was delayed 2 hours to land at 2am, their front desk person stayed late to check us in and get us settled. It was also very easy to walk to old town, but far enough away that it was still convenient for car pick ups and quiet at night."

This hotel was close to everything that hoi an had to offer and was so easy to book local tours to da nang. The luxury room was worth every penny and to be honest we never wanted to leave it. The staff was more then amazing. The house keeping giving us a good night message was the cutest thing ever. If i go back to hoi an there is no doubt i would book this hotel again. Everyone had the biggest smiles on their faces and even though it was raining most of the time the staff made the sunshine in the hotel. I can not thank laluna hotel enough.

If you want fresh coffee you had to pay which is crazy. The room was beautiful we had the suite as we had 2 kids so the space was great. The free shuttle to the beach waa great to have and a nice way to spend the day. Kim at reception was very helpful.

Location very good, facing the river and just a few minutes away from the gates of the old town service was ok, receptionist very professional and fluent in english. The service at the restaurant was below the level of what i ve experienced in other cities. Ccondition at the hotel was really noisy, absolutely poorly isolated, so you could here anything going on outside in the street or in the hallway of the hotel, even when people don t speak loud. Then on the last day the hotel started renovations of all the empty rooms at 7h00 in the morning extremely loud renovation works started in the next room. After discussing with the hotel manager, they offered to pay the taxi to the airport.

Hội An,Khách sạn & Spa Laluna Hội An Riverside,GoogleMap,Angela,"8,0",02/04/2023,"L albergo, molto vicino al centro, facilmente raggiungibile a piedi, è una struttura un po datata, con camere tradizionali, ma con uno staff molto gentile, effettua servizio di noleggio bici gratuito e servizio portineria sempre disponibile. La colazione è prettamente di cucina asiatica e intercontinentale ma non manca anche qualcosa di dolce tipo yogurt, cereali e piccoli croissant. La stanza, pulita, al primo piano con balcone, presentava la vista un po oscurata dagli alberi ma comunque carina. A disposizione prodotti come shampoo, bagnoschiuma, e accessori per la toilette erano in dotazione. Il frigobar non funzionava molto ma non ne abbiamo avuto bisogno. L aria condizionata invece, molto utile per le giornate afose, ci è stata di grande aiuto, soprattutto per rinfrescare durante la notte e togliere l umidità delle giornate calde che abbiamo incontrato. La piscina non l ho utilizzata ma comunque carina, con lettini e telo mare a disposizione degli ospiti. Nel complesso è un buon albergo."

Vị trí gần phố cổ, chừng 1.5km, gần nhiều tiện ích nên khá tiện, hồ bơi vừa đủ, độ sâu hợp lý cho gia đình có trẻ em và rất sạch.

Ban công bị gỉ sét, gia đình có con nít nên cẩn thận. Hồ bơi khá nguy hiểm, nếu cho trẻ con bơi người lớn phải giám sát vì ranh giới giữa 1.2m và 1.6m sát nhau. Khách sạn nên xem xét lại đồ ăn sáng, đoàn nhà mình hơn 10 người lớn trẻ con, nhưng không thể ăn nổi, đồ ăn vừa nguội lạnh, vừa không ngon. Ở 2 ngày mình không thể ăn sáng được gì. Nếu đánh giá của riêng cá nhân mình có thể không chính xác nhưng hơn 10 người cùng cảm nhận thì mình nghĩ chính xác, khách sạn nên xem xét và cải thiện."

While the hotel is one of the side streets of the town, it gets sufficient motorcycle traffic, however rooms are which are facing inwards/pool are very quiet. There are couple of things to mention so you should be aware - wifi very unstable. Better to come with your own data sim card - in our room there were stains on wall like from burst pipe. - aircon blows directly towards the bed. Some might like it, some - might not - water flow in shower is unstable both in terms of amount of water and the temperature as well. But for me all above was minor things for one night. Plus, staff s willingness to help - they printed our boarding passes for free - outweighed these inconveniences."

For vietnamese standards it s really clean, could be a little cleaner for western standards, but overall a good place to stay. We have discovered that vietnamese mattresses are as hard as a rock, so unless you stay in an expensive western chain hotel, you will find this everywhere. It is a bit noisy though.....not from outside noise, from other guests! doors slamming, feet thumping on stairs, loud conversations all echoed around the marble tiled foyers and stairwells and woke us/kept us awake at night. Shame really. It s a nice little hotel. We welcomed the pool at the end of long days walking. It s not huge but it s more than enough. The staff are very friendly and it s good value for money. We didn t eat here so can t comment on the food, but there is so much choice nearby you are not limited to eating hotel food."

Everyday you had the option to get noodles, pancakes, eggs, bread, fruit, yogurt, coffee and tea for breakfast. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Every day as i walked out the man at the front desk always asked if i needed any recommendations for anything and it was helpful to hear what the locals recommend.

We were greeted by a staff that wanted to welcome us and serve our every need. The woman who sat down with us spoke nearly fluent english which was nice for us. The hotel is adorable, with books lining the walls and colorful cushions adorning the comfy seats (this is the breakfast area too-really inviting and cute) in the front there is an outdoor coffee area where we sat and sipped and watched people. The hotel is located centrally but not on the busiest of streets. We could walk easily everywhere-to shopping, eating, night market. It was the most perfect location. Our room was small but clean, adorable,nice. Our daughter slept in an upstairs loft area that was spacious and cute. This was perfect privacy at this cost. She didn t mind the few stairs at all-and she loved the privacy. Beds were comfy and clean. Bathroom was nice. When i booked i didn t notice that there wasn t an elevator (we were on 4th floor) i m so glad i didn t because i probably wouldn t have booked here/which would have been a major loss. The stairs werent bad at all. They were open and airy-not regular dark hotel stairs. And the staff insisted on carrying our luggage up and down, so it was just a little more exercise that didn t hurt us after our wonderful nearby foody excursions! the shopping around this hotel was great. Best feature of this unique hotel was the helpful friendly staff. We loved them and this hotel."

Next door there is a hotel being renovated so there is a very loud drilling noise early in the morning (not every day though)...we talked to them and they moved us to the opposite wing of the hotel and it did help a lot actually...so if you go there soon, just request to be put in a room opposite of the construction and it should be good enough. Breakfast was very good, tasty and fresh...they make fresh omelets right there for you and there are options to add like fried rice, pho, bakeries, fruit, etc. The pool at the top is very refreshing if you want to come back for a quick swim during the day and take a break.

Going down to the lobby or sitting by the pool helped. The hotel is within walking distance of the ancient town, lantern bridge, the day market, night market, the lune theatre. All the attractions are close by. The staff were fantastic and helpful all round and especially with arranging an electric shuttle for us to get about for a tour as my husband does not walk well. We looked forward every morning to the breakfasts and never got tired of them."

Hội An,Khách sạn Hoi An Pho Library,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",03/12/2019,"This hotel is in a great location - off a main street so pretty quiet, yet within a short walk to the old center of town. Very convienient. I wish we found this place earlier! great rooftop pool, and my kids loved the hotel room. We stayed in the room with a loft bed up some steps - so the kids felt they had some privacy and space for themselves. Very nicely decorated and breakfast options were plentiful. No elevator in this building which may bother some people. Bathroom was on the smaller end but not a deal breaker for us. Nicest hotel room we ve stayed in this trip."

Auch die rückfahrt zum bahnhof mit einem fahrer vom hotel war super. Trotz unserer frühen anreise (7 uhr morgens) konnten wir schon das zimmer beziehen. Der pool auf dem dach ist wunderschön und lädt zum bahnen schwimmen ein, handtücher gibt es am pool und bademäntel auf dem zimmer. Das zimmer war großzügig eingerichtet (wir hatten ein super breites, bequemes doppelbett) und auf dem balkon konnte man gut sitzen (blick nach hinten in ein ruhiges viertel). Hier wäre nur eine aufhänger-möglichkeit für die nassen badesachen gut gewesen. Frühstücksbuffet lecker und reichhaltig von 6 bis 10 uhr morgens. Absoluter pluspunkt war dass wir vor unserer abendlichen abreise aus dem hotel noch einmal kostenlos duschen durften und dafür auch handtücher vom hotel gestellt bekommen haben. Die lage des hotels ist für die besichtigung der altstadt super, in nur 5 gehminuten ist man an der japanischen brücke. Zum strand sind es etwas über 3 km vom hotel aus, aber dort sind wir nicht hingegangen."

Trong lúc chờ bọn mình được nhân viên mời uống nước ép và hoa quả, đưa bản đồ hội an và hướng dẫn chỗ chơi cụ thể. Đồ ăn sáng khá ngon và nhiều món để lựa. Về phòng ở thì siêu ưng, ưng từ màu sắc đến nội thất. Trong tủ khách sạn còn để 2 áo choàng dài và 2 ô dài cùng tông màu với phòng nữa. Cũng ưng bể bơi luôn nè. Điểm trừ duy nhất là khoá phòng hơi ọp ẹp và cửa ra ban công của phòng 201 không đóng chặt hẳn được í.

Hội An,Khách sạn Hải Yến,GoogleMap,Kyla,"8,0",23/04/2018,"We booked this place for the pool, had been traveling through vietnam for a while and wanted some chill time. In that respect the hotel didn t disappoint, it was an oasis of calm by the pool in bustling hoi an town. Unfortunately we had room 128 which was ground floor pool side. Lovely until both nights people came back at 2 am, shouting, drinking and jumping in the pool. I called reception but there was no answer. Asked the people to chill as they were sat on a table right outside our room and they did move to be fair. Just felt the hotel could deal with this better, perhaps ask people to sit away from the bedroom windows at night. The hotel booked our onward travel including train which was really helpful. Comfy bed and an actual bath with shower over rather than wet room which is popular here. Overall would recommend, but ask for a room at the back, not ground floor."

But in the morning the staff was talking very loudly outsider our door at 7 00 am! very rude! the pool wasn t very clean, there were these wierd plastic fibre sticks floating around everywhere in the pool...

Hội An,Khách sạn Hải Yến,Traveloka,Siddharth,"10,0",16/02/2020,"I stayed here for the second time in 2 years. Hai yen has a great location, nice rooms, great swimming pool and a lot of nice facilities such as laundry, scooter rentals, taxi to/ from da nang airport available at the reception. From the instant we entered the hotel premises, we had a staff member coming and picking our bags and carrying it to the room. The room had all the facilities- ac, bathroom with hot shower, bottled water, double bed with toilet amenities. The front-desk was very resourceful in making sure to arrange everything for us, and i didn t have to worry on how to return scooter with flight at 7 am in the morning. They included filling petrol as well, at a slight premium (50 cents in usd) thus saving me a lot of time and hassle in filling petrol. As for our taxi, we changed the time at the last moment and the front-desk was very cooperative in getting it successfully done for us. All this for dirt cheap prices. The only slight complaint i had is this time the room i got was slightly smaller than last time, when i came alone and got 2 double beds which was lavish. The other thing was that we had a cockroach in the bathroom. I was able to kill the roach without much issues, but it wasn t great to have this small inconvenience. Of course if we called the staff, they would have helped us out but we didn t need to. But in an otherwise extremely clean hotel, this was a small annoyance."

They helped with reservations and taxis and even allowed me to shower after i checked out because i had a late flight after a day of swimming. The room was very comfortable i slept like a baby. Even though we were close to all the music and festivities of old town, i didn t hear any of it. It was a perfect place to venture out from. So close to old town (just cross the bridge at the corner!). And from the front porch restaurant, you can watch all the people going by. It was so perfect! highly recommend!"

In our room there was a leak behind the toilet and in our son s room the a/c unit on the wall next to the door was leaking. He had to put towel on the floor or have the unit turned off. Not ideal considering heat and humidity. Otherwise really nice hotel. Very close to the shopping and bars and restaurants but quiet. Everyone was super nice and attentive. Each room had two big umbrellas to borrow. Really good idea during raining season. Breakfast not as good as other hotels we stayed in during our trip but still good.

Hội An,Khách sạn Lantana Boutique Hội An,GoogleMap,Saibeth,"10,0",19/06/2023,"This was our second stay at this hotel, and just like the first time in 2018, it was fabulous. The rooms are large and airy, with the ones facing the river having doors that open on to a small balcony. The staff are just amazing, friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble and they say hello every time you come back through the lobby. The ground floor was renovated during covid and looks amazing. The only small issue is that it is quite a loud hotel inside. Not from street noise, they have excellent windows, but from the central atrium space. Tiled floors are great for the climate, but loud voices and slamming doors echo! maybe some rugs would help? if someone could invent a way for hotel doors all over the world to close quietly, they d make a fortune! we loved staying here, and will again next time we are in hoi an."

Hội An,Khách sạn Lantana Boutique Hội An,Traveloka,Peggy,"6,0",27/01/2025,"Let me preface this review by acknowledging that our arrival was shortly after the city had flooded, so understanding the weather may have factored into our review. Our flight was delayed so we arrived quite late and they accommodated late check-in which we appreciated. However, shortly after check-in we realized how outdated the hotel was. The property just seemed a bit dingy and was musty (likely due to the rain) including the bedding. The pillows smelled of mildew and there appeared to be mold on the ceilings. The room itself was clean enough but it didn t appear that they vacuumed or swept well as there was so much hair everywhere including the body soap dispenser. And i m not talking about on the bottle, i m talking about a hair in the spout. Very bizzare...either way, we weren t staying in the room much so brushed it off. Location was good as right near the main strip area, but far enough away from the craziness. Breakfast was included and did the go, nothing too exciting but had different options on a daily basis. Overall, our stay was fine but had some flaws."

The rooms and the entire hotel are exquisitely decorated with stylish decor, the staff are working round the clock with friendly service and high english skills, and the location is very close to downtown. The breakfast comes with fruit and pastries, along with a personal order from a wide selection of choices. Though do expect to get watery juice if you order more than 1-2 glasses. The only minus is the amount of hot water as we could not both take hot baths right after each other, but this might have to do with the fact that we visited in february. The complimentary herbal foot bath every night is an extra bonus after hours of downtown walking."

Hội An,Khách sạn Maison Vy,GoogleMap,Susan,"10,0",15/05/2019,"The only drawback to this hotel is the absence of an elevator. If you re able to walk up one or two flights of stairs (with staff bringing your bags), this is an excellent choice. It s a short walk to the old town area and a free shuttle. On our full moon night there was an amazing lantern festival enjoyed by tourists and lots of vietnamese. Maison vy has 7 stations for the complimentary breakfast (5 in photos), and free afternoon tea was our substitute for lunch. The reading room was a great place to relax after walking around the old town. We found the best shopping here from our entire vietnam trip. The free herbal foot footbath was perfect to end our day."

Total coordination from a piece of chair to color of this house wall, i was so impressed the total produce of ms vy. I felt her unwavering philosophy of imagination. People of course, they welcome guests always. But, not only that but also they communicate so well, quickly and efficiently. I told about my allergenic things to 1 staff in the restaurant at the dinner of the first night. From the day, i recognized that every staff in the hotel knew my allergenic food, even though it is the first time to talk to them. That was amazing earnestness for the guests. Food needless to say, the food is awesome. It (including thecomplimentary breakfast) was sophisticated and delicious far beyond of my imagination."

The rooms are quite new and modern yet maintain provincial vietnamese charm. As i stepped out onto my balcony i overlooked and the thu bon river, and an undeveloped marsh. Staff more than helpful. Motorbikes were easy to rent (there s a place directly neighboring the hotel). I would definitely return to this property when venturing to hoi an in the future."

The hotel staff are helpful and cheerful (which is not always the case in vietnam). The only issue is that the roosters were crowing all night. If you stay at the cheapest room, you will probably hear it alll night. Luckily i reflected the issue to the reception, and was upgraded to a quieter room for my remaining two nights. Again, do not book the cheapest rooms, since your sleep will very likely be disrupted by the non stop roosters. And they are loud!"

I stayed for 2 nights with mom(50 s) during 2016 mid-autumn holidays in this hotel. Hotel staffs were kind, breakfast was good, swimming pool is clean and nice and hotel room is wide enough and clean. Hotel s location is little far from the old town so it s too hot to walk at day time but you can go to old town on foot in other times. It s very good place to taking a rest, hotel is surrounded by river and field, so it s very silent and peaceful. I d like to stay in this hotel again if i can go to hoi an again. And reception staff ms.hoang was so kind and friendly, she helped us a lot for getting our luggages from airport. Thank you so much for your help and nice memory."

Hội An,Khách sạn Odyssey Hội An,Traveloka,Cathie,"6,0",13/03/2017,"We stayed 4 nights in the jr honeymoon suite . The visual appeal was great but the functionality of the room left things to be desired. Suite was a little overstated. Though the room was generous in size, the bathroom sink, tub, bed area, chairs and small table were all in one area (open concept). Bathroom mirror lighting was poor as was the bedroom lighting. There were 7 ceiling lights - either all on or all off. The only other lights in the room were one small spot attached to each side of the headboard. There is one sink with little counter space. The back of the king size bed had a shelf for keeping toothbrush, toiletries, etc. The mattress was medium firm - a little too much so for my preference. The bed has an extended frame around its surcumfirance that we kept bumping our shins on. Positive things many english channels on the tv including 2 movie channels. Corner room with glass doors on both sides and access to a small balcony. There are no screens - the unit is on the second floor, we were uncomfortable to leave the doors open to avoid mosquitoes from entering. The suite has universal plugs in all the sockets so no adapters are required. There is a nice walk-in shower. The pool is small and located outside the restaurant which might be uncomfortable for some. The restaurant serves breakfast (included), lunch and dinner. We ate a very good dinner there. The hotel is located 0.8 miles from ancient town, a little more remote than some may desire."

Hội An,Khách sạn Royal Riverside Hội An,Traveloka,SUMI,"10,0",06/08/2018,"친구와함께 2박을 묶었는데 너무 좋은 경험이었습니다. 데스크직원은 말이 영어가 수월하고 벨보이가 짐을 방까지 가져다줬습니다. 어메니티는 샴푸,린스,바디워시,면봉,빗,치약칫솔,머리가운(?),반짓고리,머리수건,몸수건,욕조수건이 제공되고 화장실에 얼굴용 고정거울이 있습니다. 장점은 수영장과 스파가 있는데 수영장이 1.8미터가 최고고 절반정도가 그래서 수영하기 좋고 썬베드가 안락합니다 (6개) 구명조끼와 수건이 무료제공됩니다. 스파는 다소 다낭보다 비싸나 20프로 할인됩니다.호이안에는 스파집이 많으니 다른곳에서 받으셔도 좋을 것 같습니다. 조식은 그저그러했고 롯데마트에서 과일을 사먹어본 결과 별로 조식과일은 달지 않습니다. 하지맛 만 먹을만하고 김치가 있다는게 인상적이네요. 룸 컨디션은 상당히 좋았고 넓었습니다. 하루에 한번 지역신화에 관한 종이를 전달해주는데 흥미롭고 재미있었습니다. 하지만 수시로 방을 치워주시니 귀중품 도난에 주의해야할 듯 싶습니다. 안에는 우산과 샤워가운, 금고등이 있고 냉장고에는 키캣과 맥주 물등이 있으나 금액이 청구됩니다. 후에 리셉션에서 무엇을 썼는지 물어봅니다. 지역상 올드타운과 야시장이 가깝고 좋았으며 뒤쪽으로는 시내가 위치하고 조금 구석진곳이나 너무 멀게 구석지지는 않아 조용하니 위치로는 최적입니다. 서양인이 많아 한국인은 저희뿐이었습니다. 하루에 두번, 10시30분과 2시쯤 안방비치로의 셔틀버스를 운영하는데 저희는 그냥 택시를 이용했습니다. 안방비치는 너무 좋았으나 짐을 맡길곳이 없어 슬펐습니다... 하루 3만원돈에 이런 호화를 누려 너무나 행복했습니다. 다음에 오더라도 또 이곳에 묶고싶네요. 부모님과 함께요!! 아, 올드타운은 제가 겪었던 삐끼중 최악이었습니다. 심지어 한시장보다요. 특히 배타고 소원종이 보내는 다리근처는 상상이상으로 심각하고 올드타운 물가는 한국물가와 비슷합니다. 조심하세요!"
Hội An,Khách sạn Royal Riverside Hội An,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"6,0",16/02/2019,"Good staff was friendly and remembered our names, room was generally clean, bed comfortable. Bad location a bit out of the way, room smelled faintly of stale cigarette smoke, they allow smoking in hotel common areas, we had 3 rooms and service was a bit inconsistent amongst them (some people got a turndown service and better cleaning while others didn t), they tried to charge us twice for a tour that we booked after one of the people in our group had already paid for it. Don t think that was on purpose but more due to lack of organization and i would have paid it if the person in our group wasn t next to me to tell me he already took care of it. Room door closers don t shut the door all the way and there s an annoying alarm that goes off if the door is not shut so we heard a lot of that. Just get better closers so we don t have to hear that jarring alarm."

We ended up staying elsewhere as the hotel is filthy and has a strong musty smell. There were holes in the sheets and mound around the taps in the bathroom. The woman on reception was very nice and offered to find us a new room, but given the state of our original room and the hotel common areas, we felt that any room was going to be in a similar state. We didn t ask for a refund, we just left."

Hội An,Khách sạn Thanh Binh Riverside,Traveloka,Dids,"10,0",19/08/2018,"After our flight from sydney to singapore left 1 1/2 hours late from sydney, we missed our transfer flights from singapore to da nang airport, we phone our accommodation to tell them not to pick us up that night and they were so nice. They were happy to still pick us up the next day which then was another 1 1/2 late again. We were greeted with a wide smile and as always wonderful hospitality. Thahn bin resort riverside hotel is the secong time we have stayed there before as it is not only lovely accommodation , but is walking distance to old city hoi ann, and the night markets and they have their own bicycles you can hire straight out the front which we road everyday for 40,000dong each all daytill 10.00pm at night. The rooms are clean and beautifully modern with lots of marble floors and very large rooms. The beds are comfy and the much needed air conditioners work great to keep you cool. The breakfast is great with all different cuisine and the staff are so friendly and warm. Nothing is too hard for them. They booked us trips without any fuss and organized anything we needed with a smile. I highly recommend this place with 5/5 stars in all aspects. We will be back to stay again. Thank you once again for transport back to da nang and a history lesson on the way back to the airport. Lovely kind people. Highly recommend."
Hội An,Khách sạn Thanh Binh Riverside,Traveloka,Jon,"8,0",06/08/2018,"A colonial looking building near the riverside, the building was a little dated, lift and stairs were a little worn, but the pool was good, albeit crowded. The view of the pool/river is pleasant, however the other side had absolutely nothing to see, in fact we had to keep the curtains drawn because of construction across the road. Good location, close to the ancient town of hoi an, and also short walk to the night market. Buffet breakfast was sufficient, staples were a little bland but there was enough variety, the selection did not change much from day-to-day. Our group of 7 (4 rooms) noticed a significant difference in the air-conditioning with the double rooms (both garden and river views) having much more powerful ac compared to the garden view twin rooms."

Nhưng bọn mình được anh chủ tiếp đón rất nồng hậu, nhiệt tình. Homestay xinh xắn, trang trí rất có gu, mới và sạch sẽ. Bọn mình thấy rất bất ngờ khi anh chủ thông báo bữa sáng sẽ được phục vụ miễn phí ngay tại homestay luôn (thực ra mình đoán đã có trong tiền phòng hết rồi) gồm có bánh mì madam khánh, cà phê/nước cam và 1 đĩa trái cây. Quá tiện lợi. Homestay sẽ có khoảng 4-5 chiếc xe đạp để cho khách mượn free để đi dạo thong dong trong phố cổ. Phòng bọn mình là phòng 3 người trên tầng hôm đó là rằm nên nhìn từ cửa sổ phòng có thể ngắm trăng rằm ở bên ngoài. Bàn ghế trong phòng mang hơi hướng cổ điển cùng với cái gối ôm họa tiết chim công phượng. Bạn sẽ tìm được khá nhiều góc sống ảo ở trong phòng. Phòng tắm rộng rãi sạch sẽ. Bạn nào sống theo kiểu zero waste sẽ rất thích đồ dùng trong phòng tắm, vì sữa tắm và dầu gội thay vì mua dạng gói nhỏ thì sẽ được đựng trong chai bằng gốm, còn bàn chải và kem đánh răng được đựng trong gói bằng giấy xơ dừa. Cá nhân mình rất thích mùi dầu tràm của sữa tắm và dầu gội ở đây. Điểm trừ duy nhất có lẽ là cái vòi tắm hơi hiện đại quá nên bọn mình phải loay hoay một lúc mới biết dùng )) mình nghĩ chủ nhà nên dán thêm cái note hướng dẫn sử dụng cho an toàn rất tiếc là bọn mình chỉ ở hội an 1 đêm. Lần sau quay lại hội an, chắc chắc bọn mình sẽ chọn la an cho la an 10/10 luôn 3"

Đã đặt một phòng đôi nhưng thật ngạc nhiên khi nhận được một phòng cho ba người mặc dù danh sách nói rằng nâng cấp miễn phí. Được rồi, không giống như các homestay khác, các phòng ở đây cũng xa xỉ như trong các khách sạn, tương tự về nội thất và thiết kế hiện đại. Nhưng một lần nữa, có một khu vực chung đẹp mắt ở tầng trệt có khu vực ăn uống và phòng khách, nhắc nhở bạn rằng đây là một homestay. Thêm vào cảm giác ấm cúng của nơi này là chủ nhà ấm áp, thân thiện. Họ không nói nhiều tiếng anh, nhưng họ cố gắng giúp đỡ. Bữa sáng miễn phí! họ sẽ cho bạn một đĩa trứng và thịt xông khói hoặc một bát phở, trong số rất nhiều món ăn (nhưng bạn phải gọi món tối hôm trước). Về vị trí, nơi này khá xa so với phố cổ (khoảng 20 phút đi bộ), nhưng với xe đạp và xe hơi của grab bây giờ ở hội an, bạn có thể đến đó với giá rẻ. Nói chung, đây là homestay tốt nhất tôi từng ở việt nam, hoặc châu á cho vấn đề đó.

In my case after travelling 12 hours overnight i was ready to go to my room, but was pushed tours even though i wasn t interested. Once checked in this wasn t an issue any more and the staff were friendly and accommodating."
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Ladan,"10,0",22/04/2025,"This place was great. Close to the old town by thu bon river, the chaos of the night life, but very easily walk away quiet. The most noise is kids playing in the street during the day, which was pretty cute. Tons of options for food nearby. Rented bicycles that made it so easy to get to the rice fields explore a bit. The place was clean, alot of light. The shower was unique, no shower curtain the drain is behind the toilet. Definitely different, but you dry the floor with a towel turn on the fan. Bed is comfy. Walls a bit thin but nothing ear plugs cant help. Breakfast was delicious, mix of local western varities. So many fruits. They do offer to giv you to go if you have an early transfer out. Staff are lovely so helpful. I did use the pool even though it was much too cold for it - wanted to test it out its also very unique. Definitely recommend this spot!"

Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,GoogleMap,Cathy,"6,0",27/02/2025,"Très bien située et offre un bon petit-déjeuner. Le personnel est attentionné et toujours prêt à aider. Toutefois, notre chambre était très humide et il y avait une odeur de moisissures. La peinture du bas de mur étaient écaillée et les oreillers avaient une très mauvaise odeur, ce qui est dommage."
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Uyen Thy,"6,0",19/02/2025,"The hotel could use some refurbishing but i understand properties in vietnam (if not major chains) are older and charming. This hotel was definitely charming and located in a very ideal location close to shops and restaurants and the night market. I am giving it 3 stars for the strangeness of the bathroom which is one open space. Also, the outlet has a panel which makes it also impossible to plug if you are using an adapter. I would like to give 10 stars, however, to the wonderful and helpful staff. Overall, good hotel if you plan to stay a couple of night. By the way, daily breakfast is exceptional!!"
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Yorllana,"6,0",12/02/2025,"We stayed two nights, loved that hotel was located in old town. Disliked the loud neighbors we had at night. Lili and ana were very helpful in booking our tours. The hotel could be cleaner especially bed and restroom. It s a very affordable stay so knew it was not going to be top notch. We felt safe and it was ok."

Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Ashley,"2,0",24/01/2025,"The staff were nice enough however the hotel was awful. Quite possibly the worst place i ve ever stayed. The room, bathroom, towels and bedding were dirty. Lots of things were broken or breaking inside the room with electrical wires exposed. After one night i left the hotel and found accommodation elsewhere as i couldn t stay any longer and the facilities were so poor i couldn t even bring myself to shower in the dirty bathroom or use their towels. The hot items at breakfast were cold and when i opted for cold options the cereals etc were stale and the options of both hot and cold foods were extremely limited. Also be warned the hotel is located on the central island in hoi an and when the river flooded you had to walk through knee deep water to get to the hotel and this is a regular occurrence. Due to the proximity to the street market the roads near the hotel close so you can only access the hotel by foot. The hotel is also not accessibility friendly with steps up from the street and stairs up to all rooms in the property. Avoid at all costs."
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,David,"10,0",23/04/2025,"Great location, block away from the night market and right across the river from all the shops and restaurants. Nice breakfast and awesome staff. Even though you re so close to all the nightlife i found it nice and quiet for a great nights sleep. The cool pool was a great way to wash away the stickiness from a day about town. I enjoyed my stay. Thank ladies!"

Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Samnang,"8,0",25/01/2025,"The staff is the strongest part of this establishment. From the front house and to the back. Bed is extremely comfortable. My only gripe might be room dependent. The walls had mould and the balcony door wouldn t lock. It has a shared balcony with the neighbor. At its price point, it still hold value depending on your comfort tolerance. To circle back, the staff is absolutely hospitable from the beginning and end."

We did the cooking class with coconut boats and the night lantern boat with the memories show and both were definitely worth the money. The location is very convenient to the ancient city and within a very short walk to amazing food options.

Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,John,"10,0",05/06/2025,Great little hotel on the old town island. Located a street back from the main bar area but no noise on a night.

Hoi an.. All round great value for money. Super location.
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Callum,"10,0",18/05/2025,The design of la a definitely fits in well with the surrounding charm of hoi an. Even better is the location walking distance to old town or stay near by at night for the night markets and bars. Customer service was exceptional too!
Hội An,La An Old Town Hotel,Traveloka,Till,"8,0",22/08/2025,"Great location within walking distance to the city centre of hoi an yet really peaceful and quiet at night. The room was great, the shower in the wooden bathtub was a little bit odd but good. Breakfast was alright. Overall excellent price/value! bike rental possible, but bikes pretty crappy. Motorbike was good. Why i can only give 4 stars and not 5 stars is the very aggressive approach right on arrival of talking us into booking additional tours or visiting an open air show etc. I found that pretty annoying to be honest. You can say no to all this but it will take some energy away from you ) additional travel advice have dinner at morning glory signature restaurant, 1st floor balcony, make a reservation! you will not regret that )"

Hội An,La Siesta Hoi An Resort & Spa,Traveloka,Dale Deo,"10,0",15/06/2025,"This was my first time visiting vietnam, and this resort and spa instantly became a place i ll always treasure. Nestled in a lush, tropical rainforest setting, the atmosphere was both serene and enchanting like stepping into a dream. The calming energy, thoughtful design, and magical ambiance created a deeply restorative experience. From the moment i arrived, the customer service was exceptional. Every staff member from the front desk to the spa therapists and dining team was warm, welcoming, and genuinely attentive. Always smiling, always acknowledging, they made me feel seen and valued throughout my stay. The food was another highlight fresh, delicious, and made with locally sourced ingredients. It s something i deeply appreciate and wholeheartedly support. Every bite reflected care and quality. I treated myself to two long massages, and both were among the best i ve ever had expertly delivered in an immaculate, peaceful space. The spa staff had a true gift for healing and relaxation. Leaving this place was bittersweet. It was more than a vacation it was a soul-refreshing experience. I ll carry the memories with me, and without question, i know exactly where i ll return when i need to feel grounded, cared for, and inspired again."

Hội An,La Siesta Hoi An Resort & Spa,Traveloka,Katherine,"6,0",02/07/2025,The hotel itself is fine. We didn t get off to a good start when our first meal on arrival was not very good. The fridge in our room was not very cold. All our other meals were fine and we were able to get an ice bucket to remedy the not so cold fridge. The one big problem i had at the resort was the staff. They have obviously been trained to engage with guests and check that everything is ok. The conversation would then progress to what your plans were and the weather. It went on forever. This is lovely until it reaches the point that you are constantly interrupted and hassled incessantly. It was over the top. The resorts training needs to include when to back off and stop annoying the guest and let them have a holiday!

For breakfast, the com hoi was a standout, and honestly, all the food was amazing. There were so many beautiful pools to enjoy we were never bored, and our child had a blast.

Great friendly and helpful staff, beautiful grounds including pools, wonderful food at the restaurants, and great spa. Located just outside of old town only 10-15 walk to there which made it nice to not be right inside old town. Even though a room upgrade was not offered or mentioned at checkin, they immediately contacted me with an upgrade after i had reviewed the checkin process. The only minor thing i wish they would add would be shuttle service to old town after 3pm (that s the latest shuttle). Overall this was a great hotel that i would highly recommend and i would definitely stay there again."

Our room was huge, with separate room with a spa bath tub and showers. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I liked the way one of the restaurant bars gave you 2 happy hour options, one at normal happy hour times and the other at 8pm time. The hotel is about 1km from the action of hoi an and that made it quieter and only a couple of dollars in a cab so we loved this aspect of it"

I recently had the pleasure of staying at your beautiful hotel in da nang, and even after returning home, the heartfelt memories from our visit still linger vividly. I felt compelled to write and express my sincere gratitude especially to ms. Quynh (chloe), who made our stay truly exceptional. From the moment we checked in until the time we departed, ms. Quynh s thoughtfulness and attentiveness were consistently remarkable. Thanks to her kindness, our entire trip became filled with joyful and unforgettable moments. Most notably, in celebration of my girlfriend s birthday, she arranged a lovely congratulatory message on our bed, which made the occasion extra meaningful. When we experienced a minor issue with our room, she was the first to come and help, handling the situation swiftly and professionally. What could have been a stressful situation instead became a special memory, all thanks to ms. Quynh s genuine care and warmth. She consistently checked in on us to ensure we were comfortable and went out of her way to recommend delicious vietnamese dishes during breakfast adding a personal and memorable touch to each morning. La siesta hoi an resort spa is truly fortunate to have such a gem in ms. Quynh. Because of her, we are already looking forward to returning on our next trip to da nang.

The resort is beautifully set-up, with all facilities and good rooms (stayed in junior suite). The key downside is that this is a 20 to 25 minute walk from the main area and the hotel shuttle runs at very limited intervals. The 3 separate pools are excellent and staff is very helpful. The breakfast was good and had variety and the team was superb. The only cons for my stay were that there was not separator between the shower area and room in one room (in our second room there was a sheer curtain). The sheets though clean, had a lot of stains."

Hội An,Lakeview Villa Homestay Hoi An,GoogleMap,Kimber,"10,0",20/05/2018,"I chose lakeview villa because i don t like the noise of town. The downside of this is that few taxi drivers know where to find the place and it is somewhat inconvenient to keep taking a cab everywhere you need to go. Fares ran from 70,000 vnd to 100,000 vnd even though we always departed from the same point in town. Furthermore, we were out far enough that the tourist agencies wouldn t provide pick up at the homestay and that caused some trouble for our hostess, i m sad to say. That being said, i would still be willing to stay with this family again. Everything was bright and clean. The room was of a good size and the beds comfortable. The bathroom was easy to use and very clean! whatever she s using in the laundry makes the sheets and towels smell fantastic! the food was good. She even had a mini-fridge in the room where we kept snacks that we had bought in town. We had good wi-fi reception. The service was excellent and her prices reasonable. To get us to my son, she had to ride with us to a nearby hotel at 4 in the morning to meet the tour bus. She didn t bat an eyelash at the early hour. She was unbelievably chipper. We were very pleased with the whole experience! my only regret is that i never had time to swim in the infinity pool!"

Die entscheidung für dieses homestay haben wir nicht bereut. Alle bilder, die wir im internet zuvor gesehen haben entsprechen wirklich der realität. Wir würden jederzeit wieder dahin gehen."
Hội An,Lang Dong An Bang,Traveloka,Jennyb,"10,0",07/02/2017,"This hotel is 5 minutes from an bang beach and the area is like stepping back in time. But the hotel is new and the rooms are amazing. We had a triple room with balcony. We had 2 huge beds and still lots of space. We also had 2 big balconies. Lovely bathroom. Mr dongs niece made us very welcome. Breakfast could be improved and we have made some suggestions. She was very helpful in arranging taxis etc. Only 3.00 into the centre of hoi an. The hotel is also in a very quiet area. 3 minutes from the hotel is mr dongs restaurant en route to the beach. Fantastic restaurant, cheap and a wonderful chef. We also had a cooking class there which was great fun and our efforts, with help, were delicious. Lots of extras, like umbrellas. Laundry, shopping basket, rain macs. We would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again. One of our favourites on our trip. And also very cheap"

They also assisted us with booking train tickets from danang to hue, as well as arranging private transfer to the danang train station for a small fee. One thing to be mindful is that the location of this hotel is in fact 15-20 minutes walk along the river to the centre of the old town. It is not 5-10 minutes as advertised originally - i guess is true if they are referring to the very edge of old town. The highlight of this hotel is definitely the pool, it is not massive but nice enough to cool you down and relax."

The property is in a great location, right on the river. It s about a 15-20 minute walk to the old town, which can feel a bit long in the heat, but the hotel provides shuttles at specified times to take guests there and back. It s also easy and inexpensive to take taxis to and from town. We enjoyed the quiet area that the hotel is located in, as the town is very busy. Our rooms were very attractive, well-equipped, spacious, and clean. The rooms also had great air-conditioning. The complimentary breakfast was incredible. There were so many options, including both western and vietnamese dishes, and everything that we tried was of excellent quality. We really appreciated that the hotel has its own private slice of the beach (complete with umbrellas and loungers) at an bang beach, and provides shuttles to take guests there and back at set times. We also appreciated the hotel s very affordable bike rental service. What makes this hotel exceptional, though, is the staff. Everyone was helpful, kind and professional. A special thank you to mile, the excellent manager who went above and beyond to make our stay special, and who was always responsive. A special thank you also to lucky in the hotel restaurant for great service every morning at breakfast.

Hội An,Lantana Riverside Hoi An Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",01/11/2019,"We loved lantana riverside hoi an! the staff were fabulous... All of them... All just such lovely people who genuinely care about you and your welfare, and enjoyment of your stay! location about 15 minutes walk away from the old town of hoi an and perfectly in a quiet area. Use the free shuttle to get to and from the ancient city or the hotel s private, or affiliated, beach. The beach is a must do incidentally because the location is amazing and is backed by a family run bar/restaurant which has an amazing selection of food and drinks at great prices, served at your free sunbeds or at the restaurants tables. The restaurant has basic toilet and shower facilities, too. Although further south than the busier an bang, it is leisurely walk along the waterline away if you need your water-sports fix. The hotel services included pretty much everything you wanted, or needed. We used the spa for treatments, massages and the like which were all really good. There s a small gym, and a lovely little pool, too. Food is great - the breakfast, something else in terms of selection, and snacks and meals in terms of prices, not unreasonable but there are plenty of alternatives locally just minutes away on foot. Lantana riverside is faultless in many ways, and at the price, a great place to stay given the breakfast is included, and unlimited! happy hour lasts 3 or 4 hours and cocktails start at about 4 for two. Yup, just a great place to stay. We ll be back, for sure!"

Downside is hotel is faraway from hoi an old ancient town like 20mins to 25mins. But i could still easy get a grab. The worst part came when i took their airport transfer from hotel to airport. They changed driver in the middle of the trips (that s fine) but the driver who took over brought me to a wrong airport more for jetstar and vietnam airlines. Frantically i went around asking for directions..i am glad i made it in time.if i were to miss the flight .would the hotel compensate me for the loss? i won t return again to this hotel.

Thái độ chủ nhà rất khó chịu. Khi mình sang ở đà nẵng giá 750k / đêm đã bao gồm ăn sáng, khách sạn có hồ bơi, phòng chơi trẻ em, phòng chiếu phim miễn phí. Mình book phòng ở đà nẵng cũng không hề ghi chú có trẻ em nhưng trẻ em dưới 6 tuổi hoàn toàn miễn phí. Nhân viên phục vụ từ tận cửa ra vào. May mà mình chỉ ở hội an 1 đêm chứ không ức chế, nếu ko phải vì đã chuyển khoản tiền phòng trước bọn mình đã đi tìm khách sạn khác ở rồi.

Không có chai nước miễn phí trong phòng. Vị trí, tuy nhiên, là tuyệt vời! tóm lại, chúng tôi sẽ không chọn lantern riverside vào lần tới, các dịch vụ tồi, rất không thân thiện.

Hội An,Lasenta Boutique Hotel Hoian,Traveloka,Catherine,"2,0",17/01/2025,"Worst hotel i ve ever stayed at this might be the first bad hotel review i ve ever written. I have no idea how this hotel has good reviews. The moment we went into both our rooms (two couples with two rooms), we all smelled mold. We were told it s rainy season and humidity is the reason for the musky smell. We were supposed to stay two nights and the price was reasonable so we told ourselves we would get over the smell. We woke up early the next morning to explore the beautiful hoi an, only for my husband to suffer a severe allergic reaction and go to hospital. Doctor said likely due to mold. We didn t know he was allergic. Doctor sent us to the city hospital emergency room in da nang 45 minutes away because his reaction was so bad. We came back to la sesta with all the paper work from the hospital at 2pm on day two and they still made us pay full price for night 2 despite explaining we needed to check out a day early due to a medical emergency due to the poor conditions of the hotel. Even if you don t have a mold allergy, it can cause several health problems that aren t as severe such as signs of a cold, cough, sneezing, and more. I hope this is a warning to all to not stay here under any circumstances. You re better off staying somewhere slightly more expensive for a better nights sleep, or worse a hospital bill, vacation ruined, and no hotel refund despite their own negligence."

The view of the rice paddies opposite the hotel was stunning and truly added to the serene ambiance. We also appreciated the availability of bikes, which made exploring the town both fun and convenient. While the buffet breakfast didn t offer a huge variety, it was perfect as a light meal before heading out for the day. One area for improvement would be adding more drop-off routes with the shuttle bus for easier access to key locations. Overall, a great experience with just a few small suggestions for enhancement! there was also a cafe next door for those after a vietnamese coffee of various varieties (and off site laundry services too)"

Biensûr il ne faut pas regarder dans le détail, car si on s attarde, l hôtel malgré son jeune âge, tombe déjà en décrépitude. Ici comme partout au vietnam les finitions sont rarement bien faites et tout vieillis donc prématurément. Même si elle fonctionne bien la clim parait déjà vétuste par exemple. Bien qu elle ferme tôt (19h00), la piscine à débordement est très agréable, surtout le revêtement en marbre au touché mat ! des transats et des serviettes sont à disposition gratuitement et le tout est bien orienté afin que vous puissiez profiter du soleil toute la journée. En plus, un bar de piscine est là pour vous proposer toutes sortes de boissons fraiches. Avec une profondeur maximale d 1m60 la piscine est séparée en deux, avec une pataugeoire pour les enfants... Et oui le point négatif des couples en quête de tranquilité l hôtel accueille beaucoup de groupes et de familles ! oubliez la sérénité des bananiers environnants et dites bonjour au cris des enfants ! ça vous avait manqué, hein ?! heureusement qu ils se rattrapent sur leur copieux petit déjeuner. Le choix est varié. Malheureusement le gros point négatif de cet hôtel est la literie... Très très ferme ! pour ne pas dire horriblement dure ! c est la raison pour laquelle je ne lui attribue seulement que 3 étoiles. Pour nous la nuit a été... Difficile ! mais, c est à vous de voir."

Mình ở đà nẵng 3 ngày, sau đó check out lúc 12h rồi gọi xe tới hội an (m đã book phòng trước, chồng 100 tiền phòng). Đến nơi thì tầm 12h45. Em nhân viên (ít tuổi, còn là học sinh) thấy gia đình mình tới, chưa gì đã nói nhà em 13h30 mới cho khách check in ạ mình có nói vậy để chị để đồ ở đây ngồi đợi. Trong khi nhà mình có trẻ nhỏ, mình cứ nghĩ phòng đó đang có khách chưa check out nên thôi ngồi đợi tí, với cả bé nhân viên là trẻ con nên mình không muốn nói nhiều. Sau đó tầm 13h20 thì bé nhân viên có gọi điện thoại cho ai đó (chắc là chủ villa) hỏi đã cho khách vào phòng được chưa sau đó đưa chìa khóa cho nhà mình. Lên phòng thì mình mới biết là phòng không hề có khách đang ở, tại sao họ phải cứng nhắc như vậy nhỉ? nếu không có khách đang ở thì có thể linh động cho mình nhận phòng sớm cho khách nghỉ ngơi mà, trời thì nắng nóng, nhà 4 ngưòi cả trẻ con ngồi đợi dưới phòng khách mệt vô cùng. Lên nhận phòng thì phòng nóng như cái lò, thùng rác thì không có chả biết vứt rác vào đâu. Hôm sau mình gặp 1 chị dọn phòng thì có hỏi chị đó có phải chủ nhà ko, mình muốn check out muộn vì giờ bay là buổi tối, nếu 12h out thì mình không biết đi đâu cả. Chị ấy kiểu thái độ như đuổi khách ấy, trả lời rất nhanh là không được vì kín phòng rồi thật sự lần đầu tiên sau 2 lần đi du lịch đn-ha mà mình gặp người làm dịch vụ tồi như lần này luôn.

Our room was very large and clean with a beautiful bathtub, lounge area, fridge, kettle, aircon, his and hers basin areas and a balcony overlooking the amazing gardens full of tropical flowers that surround the resort. Breakfast buffet was huge and delicious. There are two large pools to swim in overlooking the rice paddies, with a bar beside them. My only suggestion would be to make the pool water a bit cooler in summer. The staff were very special with quinnie, na, chau and others whose name i can t recall, being so helpful to us during our stay. I highly recommend this peaceful resort between the old town and an bang beach. We will return!"

Il y a deux piscines avec des transats et serviettes à disposition. Personnel sympathique, souriant et serviable. Petit déjeuner copieux, beaucoup de choix et produits de qualité ainsi comme par exemple les jus de fruits. Seule bémol, j aurais apprécié une machine à café, pour plus de variétés que juste le café noir. Nous avons aussi dîner 3 fois au restaurant, les plats étaient bons et les prix sont corrects. Les portions de pâtes pourraient être un peu plus copieuses. Notre chambre familiale était grande avec une literie confortable ainsi qu une très belle salle de bain. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour de 8 nuits dans cet établissement, que je recommande."

Linh and the other manager and their staff were amazing. Sooo helpful. If you needed something it was yours. The room was even better than expected and the grounds were unique and beautiful with multiple pools. Another reviewer said it best, at first you arrive and you are not sure and then once you settle in, interact with the staff and explore the grounds you realize it s a fantastic hotel and an awesome value. I liked that it was not in hoi an central, allowed you to go back to peace and quiet and it was easy to rent a motorbike from the team to get into town which was only a few minutes down the road. Delicious breakfast and food at restaurant. I highly recommend hoi an ancient house."

Being a small boutique hotel there are only a handful of other guests sharing the charming breakfast/pool area and complimentary bicycles are a perfect way to explore this lovely area.

Everyone here is so friendly and intent on making our stay as enjoyable as possible. The room is very comfortable and serviced every day with thoroughness and efficiency. For a 2 week stay, the storage space is rather limited and the shower reminds you that you are in a very small local villa in rural vietnam, but that is what we were looking for! the location is wonderful, just a stone s throw from the beach, where you can choose between upmarket or lively beachclubs quiet sunbeds with at bed service or just a stroll along the beautiful white sands. There are a few hawkers, but if you take the time to chat, they are nice friendly people. In the evening there is a great selection of amazing local family restaurants within a few minutes walk as well as the more lively beach front bars with food and music. Hoi an is only a short taxi ride away, which is a must see both day and night. The only reason i didn t award 5 stars is because the facilities are a little basic compared to larger (and more expensive) hotels. For service and value, this would take some beating."

We had had a very busy trip before arriving here so it was so nice to relax in the peace and quiet of the surrounding area. We used the free bikes to reach both hoi an town and the beach area which was a great way to get around. A grab taxi is only 60k dong to the old town if you did want to jump a car though. Ms tram and her team were so friendly and always on hand to help with anything. My boyfriend particularly liked the mango pancake ms tram made him for our last breakfast! we would 100 stay at this property if we were in the area again and wouldn t hesitate to recommend to friends family.

Our stay in hoi an was supposed to be one night but it got extended due to my sister being very sick. It was a scary time for the both of us but i could honestly not think of a better hotel where this could have happened. First, the hotel is modern, clean and eco-friendly as it was recently built in the food was good and the room service was appreciated as my sister was unable to walk down to the restaurant. However, the true shining stars of this hotel are the staff. I can t even begin to tell you all how grateful i am for all their help during those stressful few days. Zoe - i can t thank you enough for all your support during those three days. From your kind check-in messages to helping me contact the local doctor, you truly did everything you could to help us both. Thank you for being our rock during those stressful days. Ni, kim, mei and flower - thank you for the extra touches with the room service and making special meals and drinks for my sister. Shawn- thank you for the lift to the atm so i could pay the doctor. Jamie, selena and mia - thank you for helping me speak with the airline company and cancel all the other bookings. All three of you were always ready to lend a hand and went out of your way to help me in any way you could. All in all, i highly highly recommend this hotel to all travellers and we will definitely stay here again when we return to hoi an."

Just removed enough from the action to have it feel peaceful coming home , but easy to get to everything. Very very clean, with comfy beds. We had an interior room. Felt a little cramped but it was nice to be able to open the balcony doors for fresh air if not for a view (faces a narrow courtyard). Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful! my only critique is the breakfast. It s relatively big, but they don t replenish anything as service goes on. With an hour left of breakfast, only about 1/3 remained of the options and often what was left looked very unappealing - dried out fruit, scrapings of a noodle salad, etc. Thank goodness for the egg station. They house a lot of tour groups it seems, and i understand that a big seating can wipe out a lot at once, but we were there 4 days and this was a problem every day.

The rooms are large, well appointed beds very comfortable indeed (a big bonus point for that!) breakfast is plentiful with an excellent choice and again the staff very attentive. Location is good and an easy stroll into the main part of town and river. Also a very good tailor opposite. I purposefully wanted a smaller hotel rather than the usual grand dames i frequent in ho chi minh city. I m also in the travel industry which makes me doubly critical of every detail from cleanliness to customer service, food and a good comfy bed.

Hội An,Little Residence. A Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",29/08/2018,"It is a nice and cozy hotel with good location, just 7-8 minutes walk to the old town. Staff members are helpful and friendly. However, rooms with lantern view is a bit tricky. They have a balcony facing the side wall of the building next door and lanterns are hung in-between the rooms and the wall for decoration. The rooms are dark as they face a giant wall without any view but just some lanterns. Luckily, we voiced out our disappointment once we stepped into the room and finally they arranged us another room with a real balcony view. Anyway the hotel is a good one but rooms said to be with lantern view are not recommended at all."

They provided my friends and i free bicycles to the beach with map and clear direction. A friend of my burned the iron accidentally and the hotel didn t claim anything on us but helped her to iron her dress. The next day we checked out late and staff was still very happy and helpful . My friend forgot her passport and other important papers in the hotel and we only knew about that when we arrived at the hotel in da nang which was 30km far from hoi an. We made a call to the hotel and they found those papers. The next morning a guy from the hotel brought her papers to our hotel in da nang. We really appreciated their help, kindness and effort. The breakfast was fanty with local food. I will come back for sure."

I found a large light brown stain on my bed sheet, dead bugs and hair next to the bathtub, and dried tooth paste on the sink faucet. I was not informed that i had to keep and return my magnetic room key card, therefore, i left them in my room while checking-out. For this, i was charged an extra 100,000vnd since they were assumed as lost. The hotel aesthetic is charming, cozy colonial style. Breakfast provided ample of choices both local, national and western dishes. Ready solid work on what could be a great hotel!"

We kept the room temperature at 18c (70f), and we were quickly refreshed after time outside in the old part of hoi an. Room was spacious and clean. Modern bathroom. Small refrigerator for cooling down our water bottles. Superb breakfast was included in room rate, including a broad assortment of western and asian foods, plus very good vietnamese white coffee . Very friendly staff. They noticed from passport inspection that my son had a birthday during our stay, and surprised us at breakfast with a large birthday cake for him (plus a bouquet of roses). When we checked out at 6am on our last day, they surprised us again with a couple tart, bagged breakfast. Overall, one of the very best hotel experiences we have experienced in world travel."

Hội An,Little Residence. A Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Alma,"8,0",11/02/2019,"We stayed here 4 years ago and enjoyed our stay at the la residencia so much we decided to return for a week in hoi an. A lot has happened in the last 4 years, hoi an itself has become extremely busy, mainly with chinese tourists and the area this hotel is in, unfortunately, has become a giant coach car park in the daytime, when the tours come in from da nang added to this a new hotel has been built completely surrounding the hotel, which has now lost its river view, the rooms they describe as lantern view are rooms that have a balcony but have the wall of the newly built hotel covered in a sort of fence with lanterns hanging on it about 6 feet from your balcony, see photo, making the rooms dark and claustrophobic, we stayed only one night in one of these rooms and asked to be moved to a room at the front, the lantern view rooms are only any good for one or two nights, it really is a shame as the staff are wonderful and the rooms are nice and comfortable and the ambiance of the hotel is good. The only other thing is there are no decent restaurants in the surrounding area, these have all gone since our last visit and now become spas and massage places, it s such a shame as hoi an itself is still a lovely place to visit."

We enjoyed having a sitting area, and we loved the river view. The boats on the river are noisy in the early evening, but late evening and mornings, the room is quiet. The pool area was lovely, and we enjoyed taking breaks from the heat there and having drinks and even lunch poolside. Breakfasts were varied and delicious, with buffet offerings that included both western and asian options. We went for massages at the spa twice, and had wonderful treatments by carol, mary, and jasmine. All the staff were excellent helpful, attentive, and courteous. A special shoutout to may, aimee, and brian. We loved the charming decor of our room and the hotel, in general, and we thought the location was ideal, being a little bit outside of the hubbub of old town, but still a very close walk, either along the river or along the street. The only negative was that the security alarm on the doors was so sensitive, it was necessary to shut the door quite hard the first time and not double check by trying the door again. We weren t the only ones on our floor with this issue, and it sometimes made for a bit of a disturbance."

Loved the location, just far enough away from centre but an easy enough 10 min walk. Walking along the river was lovely and the evening breeze a godsend! really liked the staff and supervisors coming and introducing themselves. Services explained without any hard sell not as nice some noise from other rooms and the river. Pool area in roof a little sad and the water a little warm for my tastes. No netflix on tv. Espresso martini during happy hour was pretty awful. Bed is firm, which you may or may not like, we slept well."

Close to the madness and hustle of old town and new town bars but removed by a few steps, so you can have peace and quiet while you watch the boats on the river.

Many options for eateries nearby in old town. The hotel - the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. We have upgraded for 2 nights to riverview. The view was stunning. The service was great, min, may, aimee, brian, rose and all staff are wonderful. They also surprised me with a birthday cake, that was very kind. Thanks again! free shuttle bus to the beach around 15 minutes drive. And you can get bikes from the hotel which also handy. We don t have any negative about the hotel. Will definitely come back."

Hội An,Little Riverside . A Luxury Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,sunghee,"10,0",13/10/2024,"This well-maintained historic hotel exudes original charm and offers warm hospitality. One of the main reasons i chose this hotel was to avoid generic resorts or overly modern accommodations i wanted a place with character, and this hotel delivered. My parents, both in their 70s, and i stayed in a connected room, which turned out to be one of the best decisions for our trip. We enjoyed plenty of quality time together while also having the privacy we needed. The hotel provides direct access to the river, and it s only a 10-15 minute walk to the old town. The mini bar and spa services are reasonably priced. Amiee, the hotel manager, is incredibly sweet and attentive, always ensuring that everything was comfortable and that we had the help we needed. My parents loved our stay here and would love to return if we get the chance. I hope that happens sometime in our lifetime"

Lån en cykel og kør en tur rundt i byen, eller tag en tur i deres fantastiske spa. Husk dog lige at bed om begge proslister inden du melder dig til en omgang massage. Først hører man en pris og så når man møder op siger de nåhhh, du skal have en rigtig massag og ikke bare en hygge massage, så er det en anden pris end først oplyst .

The second night there was a flood due to bad weather and there was anybody at the hotel, i was the only person at the hotel, i had to find out a way to leave the property walking barefoot through the river. Common sense tells me that if there is an emergency in town the most important people must be your guests if you own a hotel.

Ac was not functioning properly it was very cold and could not adjust temperature, windows did not close properly, the 1bdrm (rm303) bathroom had no shower curtain or door so when you re showering the entire bathroom floor is wet! there was condensation in our (outside) bedroom door.

Strålende service! syklene er gratis å låne, og du kan benytte basseng og solsenger etter utsjekking hvis du skal reise videre seint. Stedet oppleves veldig trygt. Kort vei å gå til gamlebyen og gode tips til skomaker f.eks. Eneste litt dumme er at dobbeltsengen egentlig er to senger slått sammen, så det blir grop i midten. Ac funker bra og veranda er kjekk. Frokosten er god. Men ta med noe å drepe myggen med, for vi hadde i hvert fall flere på rommet. Stedet passer kanskje ikke så bra for småbarn, da det kan være karaoke på nabobaren til kl. Det plagde ikke oss og vi ville absolutt bodd her igjen, 10/10 ganger!"

Mình đặt superior garden view nhưng khi nhận thì phòng không giống như ảnh mô tả trên traveloka, không có garden view, nội thất trong phòng cũng không giống. Bạn mình gọi điện hỏi thì chị chủ nói phòng đó có người thuê dài hạn và ngta chưa trả phòng. Nói qua nói lại cuối cùng chốt phương án giải quyết là giảm 50k tiền phòng cho bọn mình. Tiện nghi phòng kém, phòng tắm không có dầu gội, sữa tắm, lược, khăn tắm có vết rỉ sét, phòng gần như không cách âm, khách bên ngoài nói chuyện rất ồn, bên trong phòng nghe hết.

Nên thấy người nước ngoài rất niềm nở. Thấy mình thi thờ ơ không muốn nói chuyện. Khách nước ngoài thì chạy ra chủ động nói chuyện vui cười. Ở đó một ngày nhìn thấy mấy lần như vậy xảy ra. Thật là xấu hổ cho một nơi gọi là villa. Lúc vào nhận phòng thấy một ông tây mặc quần xà lỏn nằm ở phòng khách sofa. Áo thì không mặc chỉ mặc cái quần đùi nhỏ xíu nằm trên sofa dang chân lên. Thật là kinh khủng mà khách sạn không nhắc nhở nếu không lầm thì bà chủ khách sạn đang nói chuyện với ông đó. Sau đó tụi mình nhận phòng, đưa điện thoại cho bà chủ coi bà không nói một lời đưa phòng với bộ mặt lạnh nhạt rồi sau đó lại chạy đi nói chuyện với mấy người tây. Thực sự không muốn ở đây nhưng vì trả tiền trước rồi nên phải ở. Bạn tốt nhất không nên ở đây nếu không muốn bị phân biệt đối xử.

However, the hotel is overpriced for hoi an. It is not 5 star as advertised, but more like 3 star. The breakfast is very limited and basic. There seems to be only one young lady who runs the breakfast and everything else, and you depend on her for anything you need. For breakfast she served me some pancakes soaked in a super sweet chocolate concoction. When i asked for the pancakes without the chocolate concoction, she was not pleased and pretty much decided she was done with my breakfast - she brought back the menu but never returned again to my table. The service in general for any concern was again very basic, and limited to whether this young lady had the time or the interest to engage."

This place will definitely become a hot commodity and i could see this booked out in advance in the future. The two sisters running the place are friendly and always about should you have any questions. The aesthetics and interior design of the place is light and airy and very pretty. There looks to be about six-ish rooms in total for booking. We booked two nights in the family room, as a couple, as the larger single bedroom was already booked up but we don t regret paying for the extra space. The rooms are larger than in the photos and nice and clean. The balcony was great to have to see out and get some nice sunshine. The beds are on the firmer side for those that may prefer a softer bed. Note there is no elevator but the sisters will help you bring your luggage up (our was heavy and we tried to stop them and do it ourselves they were so kind and insisted). We saw solo travellers, couples and families with small toddlers here during our stay. Our cost of the booking includes breakfast and wow their breakfasts are a league of their own. To have this included in the booking price is amazing. It was a smorgasbord of delicious food. You choose your breakfast option the night before and the sisters make it for you right in their kitchen upfront and bring it all out fresh for you. Wheni in vietnam come and enjoy the vietnamese hospitality and its people and food!"

Friendly welcome when checking in and impeccable service from all staff during our stay. Good size modern spotless rooms with good bathroom and a view of the golf course. Free mini bar which was replenished daily was a bonus. A bit off the beaten track but really quite so just what we wanted. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to hoi an and da nang which makes up for the location. We ate at the restaurant twice and really enjoyed the food. The only negatives are no swimming pool and the breakfast is a set menu at the restaurant and not a buffet which is what we would have expected for the price. We booked one night and ended up staying for three so a sign we enjoyed the hotel!

Service is really prompt and friendly. The buffet breakfast was good although not a lot of variety. The kids swam in the pool. They said it was very warm for them. Maybe that s the only complain. My husband used their cute little gym. It s enough for two people. It is quite dainty. The location is the best! spa is incredible. Got absolutely spoiled! the free bike ride also adds a nice touch to our experience. Will definitely come back to this place!

The furnishings bedding and towels were old and shabby and there s a building construction site next door with constant drilling and hammering. Overall it was so disappointing that we checked out within half hour of arriving, only to be told by the receptionist that we would not get a refund for our 2 nights accommodation, paid for in advance. Very disappointing hotel and service."

Hội An,Mulberry Collection Silk Eco,Traveloka,Daniel,"8,0",28/07/2025,"Das mulberry collection silk eco hotel bietet ein insgesamt sehr gutes preis-leistungs-verhältnis. Besonders hervorzuheben ist der wunderschöne innenhof mit pool eine kleine grüne oase mitten in der stadt. Auch das frühstück war gut, allerdings sehr stark auf asiatische gäste ausgerichtet. Eine etwas größere auswahl an europäischen optionen wäre wünschenswert. Die lage des hotels ist hervorragend ruhig in einer seitengasse gelegen, aber dennoch zentral. Alles ist bequem zu fuß erreichbar. Die zimmer sind gut ausgestattet, man sieht allerdings an einigen stellen bereits kleinere abnutzungserscheinungen. Kritik gibt es für das fitnessstudio, das deutlich in die jahre gekommen ist und dringend modernisiert werden sollte. Auch der föhn im bad entspricht leider nicht dem standard eines 4-sterne-hotels hier wäre ein leistungsstärkeres modell angebracht. Insgesamt ein sehr angenehmer aufenthalt mit kleineren schwächen daher 4 von 5 sternen."
Hội An,Mulberry Collection Silk Eco,GoogleMap,Yi Xian,"8,0",31/07/2025,"Spacious room with clean bathroom. Floor was hardwood instead of the usual carpet so we could hear the upstairs occupants quite clearly if they drop things. Buffet breakfast food, though free of charge with our stay, was not great. Hotel location was good - it was located away from the main street so it wasn t noisy in the morning. Hoi an old town was also a short walk away. Staff were extremely helpful and kept offering to help us carry our bags. They also offered to help us call a driver to bring us to da nang. They quoted us 300k, which was comparable or even cheaper than grab. (we did not take them up on their offer as we were worried that the driver would demand additional payments and eventually decided to go with grab.) overall a fantastic stay for the price."

Hội An,Mulberry Collection Silk Eco,GoogleMap,Craig,"6,0",03/03/2024,"The hotel was clean and quiet and the staff were very helpful. I do however have two major concerns regarding the hotel. The first is that they advertised a free beach shuttle. This however is not available and should be removed from the listing as it played a factor in me choosing the hotel while denying their customers the service. The second concern is regarding the free bike rentals in that they are not safe to ride and someone that is not knowledgeable or experienced with bikes may get seriously hurt. The hotel makes you sign a waiver that if something happens to one of their bikes, that the customer is on the hook for over 100. The bikes however are in poor repair. Four of the bikes i tried did not have working breaks. I offered to show the employees how to fix these but they are not provided the tools necessary to maintain the bikes. Two of the four that i tried had flat tires. They do not have a pump at the hotel. Lastly, most of them looked like the bike chains had never been oiled. The result of this will be that a customer will take the bike out and get stranded when the chain breaks which by the look of their condition. Overall, it s unfortunate that the hotel cut corners on the amenities and that for this reason, i dont feel it lives up to it s 4 star billing. The reception and building staff were excellent. The flaws in the hotel are from a hotel management level not delivering what they advertise."

Thiết nghĩ thà mình đừng setup còn hơn setup mà cân sai họ càng bực thêm ,chưa đâu đi tắm hồ bơi mà không có áo phao, con nít cũng không có, tắm xong trẻ lạnh mà không cho lấy khăn lên phòng, phải để lại hồ bơi rồi đi lên ướt hết ra sàn nha.

The staff were wonderful, the buffet breakfast was exceptional, our rooms were well appointed, we liked the location and that it s an easy walk to town, and the small pool was refreshing. The pool could use a good scrub to clean it and unfortunately the pool area becomes a wind tunnel every afternoon, but that s not a big hindrance. Our only issue was in booking. As there are 6 of us, we obviously need beds for expedia and the hotel explain that the 2 connecting rooms sleep 6, but don t explain how. We arrived to find a king bed in one room and 2 single beds in the other room. You can t sleep 6 people in that configuration. Staff pushed the 2 single beds together (1 kid slept in the crack) and brought in an extra bed which solved the problem... But they charged us an extra 100 can for this for our 5 night stay. We complained to expedia but they didn t help and whoever i communicated with at the hotel via email had zero empathy. No big deal. A bit of a bad taste, but overall an exceptional stay. We would still highly recommend this hotel."

The hotel is stylish and modern and our room was beautiful and spacious, just a shame we came when it is rainy season as we could not sit out in the balcony. Breakfast was great, with a good selection. The pool area was also nice, pity we could not use it as it was too cold. There is also a private beach. The resort is 20 mins away from hoi an old town and 50 mins from danang. The resorts does provide shuttle bus to these locations which we did take advantage of, especially to hoi an where we went for dinner on a regular basis.

Hội An,Nghe Prana Hotel & Spa Hội An,Traveloka,tony,"6,0",21/04/2023,"Villa có vị trí sát bên sông, nước tĩnh lặng, sóng nhẹ lăn tăn, thơ mộng và bình yên. Kiến trúc gỗ tinh tế , biểu tượng của villa là linh vật nghê xuất hiện ở bể bơi, phù điêu nghê trang trí trên các bức tường, trong phòng nghỉ nhìn nghệ thuật, hay, chủ khách sạn có lẽ là người có thẩm mỹ đẹp. Trước khi đặt phòng, mình có xem qua web của khách sạn thấy có chương trình 6n5d ( dành cho người ăn thuần chay, yoga...) nên lúc nhận phòng mình hỏi lễ tân thì em bảo em không biết về chương trình đó, bảo mình nên lên web kiểm tra lại rồi gọi hỏi theo số điện thoại có trên web ( thay vì em kiểm tra nội bộ giùm mình) , nên thôi mình không hỏi nữa. Biết mình ăn chay nên em có nhã ý là sẽ dặn các bạn ở bếp chuẩn bị món chay ăn sáng cho mình trong 2 đêm mình ở, nhưng 2 ngày sau đó thì không có ai đá động gì cả , có lẽ em quên hoặc hứa rồi quên. Các bạn nhân viên ít cười, ít giao tiếp với người việt hơn so với khách ngoại quốc. Họ lảng tránh nhìn và ít giao tiếp bằng mắt với người việt như mình. 1 điều nhỏ, nhưng các bạn ít tinh tế như khi lấy chén dĩa trên bàn đang ăn, nhân viên hỏi khách ngoại quốc are you finished , sau đó xoay sang bàn của mình chỉ thò tay lấy mà không hỏi lời nào, mình cảm ơn thì bạn gật đầu. Khách sạn thỉnh thoảng có mở nhạc của sư ông làng mai, có pass wifi là chánh niêm nhưng nhân viên trò chuyện hơi lớn tiếng đôi khi làm mất sự yên tĩnh. Các bạn cũng hay chăm chú vào điện thoại. Mình đặt 7 đêm nhưng cách quãng, sau 2 đêm mình ra lại đà nẵng, rồi sẽ quay lại ở 5 đêm nữa. Ấn tượng về 2 đêm đầu làm mình muốn quên."

Hội An,Ngo House 2 Villa,Traveloka,Nathalie,"2,0",07/04/2025,This place and specially the owner are horrible. To avoid if you are old as they do not have any material in case of heart attack. They complain if you made spots despite the fact that they are changing the sheets every 3 days. There are rats in the courtyard. They may forget to clean your room. They refused definitely to indicate the tourist office. They give wrong indications if you ask something. They push to leave before checking time.. And when they say there is no one at the reception it means that they stay all in an other place so you will be alone in the place with the rates...

Hội An,Ngô Khánh Homestay,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"6,0",23/08/2018,Mi chiedo come expedia possa consentrerà la prenotazione in una struttura completamente in ristrutturazione e senza le norme di sicurezza necessarie . Alle 7 00 del mattino i muratori iniziavano a fare rumore e la nostra stanza era piena di sporco di cantiere e senza alcun armadio . Avevamo il letto e un comodino ... Dovrei ricevere indietro il mio denaro. Il proprietario è una persona che vuole apparire gentile ma di fatto e concentrato solo sul denaro crede con un sorriso e delle false scuse di mettere tutto a posto ma non è così. Probabilmente quando i lavori saranno terminati sarà una buona location ma non una buona homestay.

Hội An,Ngô Khánh Homestay,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",26/06/2019,"Khan was a great host. We had our previous hotel call him and tell him our plans and he met us as the ferry pulled in and he arranged a three motorcycles to bring us to the homestay. Every day he would ask what we would like to eat (our kids asked for crab) and he would serve that to us. We ate all our meals at khan s and loved everything they served. We did a snorkeling tour arranged by khan... We asked him to make sure the bot had a sun shade and he sorted it out for us. The snorting boat was a small fishing boat with some mask and snorkels but no fins (bring your own if you have them). We saw a ton of reef fish, lots of soft corals, many hard corals, three different anemones and clown fish, all in all the reef seemed very healthy. One other bonus was that he recently upgraded his whole homestay and it now has air conditioning in all the units! our family would highly recommend staying with the khan family!"

The location is fabulous, just a short drive to the old town of hoi an with out the hustle and bustle. Fronting a white sandy beach with cool clear water just off the grassed area with sun lounges and a bar. There are several reasonable restaurants just five minutes walk down the beach. We stayed in one of the beach front bungalows, which i highly recommend if it fits with your budget. The room was spacious, nicely appointed with a seating area out front to kick back, relax, and enjoy an afternoon drink. All the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful with any requests. Van greeted us at breakfast every morning and mr. Vu took care of any requirements while relaxing by the beach. (particularly blowing up the water floaties). The food at the restaurants is first class but if you want more traditional vietnamese you have to see lily at the ben tau restaurant across the road. Great food at great prices. I can recommend this resort more highly. 5 stars for location, service, friendliness, and great staff. Thanks to the palm garden resort for making our stay in hoi an so relaxing and enjoyable."

Hội An,Palm View Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Lawrence,"10,0",11/07/2016,"A family-run place that gave us a great time. We arrived 2 hours before our agreed check-in time so understandably, our room was not ready yet. However, the staff were incredibly welcoming and suggested we put our bags down and go swimming in the pool, or go cycling on their free-to-use bikes while they got ready. No complaints! after a quick trip to the beach, we found a large bowl of big, juicy (and very sweet) lychees on the table and some chocolates at our bedsides with handwritten notes wishing us sweet dreams. These touches made our stay all the more enjoyable. They even lent us a mobile phone with the owner s number attached in case we got lost. Amenities were not lacking, but though we didn t eat there, i noticed there were only 2 sets of cutlery (it was a 3-4 person room). Breakfast was on the patio, with local dishes as well as continental offerings. We were the only ones there so we devoured all of the fresh fruit, but as soon as we did, the staff brought us more straight away! they also booked us a cab to danang when we asked (we paid them directly, so we didn t have to worry about hidden charges with the cab driver) overall, the whole place is very clean and carries itself quite professionally. Service was thoughtful and courteous, and the owner is very friendly too. The only thing is that it s slightly removed from the city centre in hoi an, but that s not too much of a problem since taxis are so cheap. I d definitely recommend a stay at palm view villa!"

The bathroom door haf to be slammed in order for it to be closed, we were afraid it would break. We brought our laundry down after dinner and told it would be done at 10am. Went to collect our things and told 12pm, waited around as our swim suits were in the wash, then told it would be evening before it was done. We couldn t go to the beach or swim in the pool that day. Bikes available for free but keep in mind they are free. Half flat tires, seats that swiveled up down and side to side and wheel locks that wouldn t unlock.

Hội An,Paradise Hotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"4,0",10/03/2015,"Not entirely sure how to rate this place. For a solo traveller it isn t great. I opted for a shared room with three others, in which there were only two electricity sockets in the room and both of which were over the beds of two others and so i felt uncomfortable using them (as my phone would be dangling over their face if i left it charging over night). As a result had a dead phone which isn t great. Overall felt uncomfortable in the shared room as it was in fact just a hotel room with four beds, as opposed to a hostel. If you re travelling with friends it may be fine. The location is central enough if you are with someone, however, alone, i wouldn t feel comfortable coming home late to it. Little dark laneway leading up to it. But for the daytime, it is a handy location. Amenities free bike rental was great and a delicious breakfast included, best i ve had on my travels. Receptionists had very little english which proved difficult as i watched couples struggle to book airport transfer with them due to the language barrier. Overall there are probably better options but not the worse."

Mình chọn phú thịnh vì thấy trong hình tất cả phòng đều có ban công, mình không thích ồn ào, muốn buổi sáng có thể ra ban công ngồi uống trà với bạn thay vì xuống hồ bơi đông đúc, nhưng mà phòng nhận được đến cửa sổ cũng không có, rất là bí, có lúc đến sóng điện thoại còn không bắt được.

While the overall property itself is great, the service at their restaurants was incredibly slow, and the food and beverage team was extremely disrespectful towards us. The management went out of their way to try and make it up to us by providing us with s complementary in-villa bbq (which we thoroughly appreciated), but unfortunately the negative device experience continued and we had to often wait up to 1.5 to 2 hours for our food to arrive, for a basic order even. We also found a spider in our glass, and another glass had broken glass pieces in there - which is extremely disappointing from a basic safety and hygiene perspective. In addition to the above, the air conditioning in one of our rooms was not working throughout our 5 day stay - in spite of numerous attempts and us being patient, this never got resolved, which is quite frustrating given how much we paid for this trip. Overall our family was quite disappointed with our experience at this hotel and do not see this as a hotel that is set up to set up to accommodate families."

Hội An,Renaissance Danang Hoi An Resort & Spa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",19/02/2020,"숙박기간 4박 5일 숙박인원 13명 (성인 8명, 아동 5명) 이용 시설 더블디럭스 2개(바다뷰 2), 스위트룸 2개 평가 아무래도 호이안에서도 가장 안쪽에 있는 곳인지라 위치는 별로입니다. 다른 곳으로 이동할 경우 택시나 셔틀이 필요합니다. 다만, 셔틀이 생각보다 시간대도 애매하고 이용고객이 많아 예약이 어려울 수도 있습니다. 뗏기간이라 한국어 가능자는 없었습니다만, 매니저가 영어를 잘합니다. 마지막날 보니 한국어가능하신 분이 출근하셨더라구요. 전체적인 직원들의 친절함은 5성급에 걸맞습니다. 디럭스룸의 2개를 스위트룸으로 업그레이드 했습니다. 스위트룸과 디럭스룸의 차이가 꽤 있습니다. 비용적인 여유가 있으시거나 어르신을 모시고간 여행이라면 스위트룸 업그레이드 추천합니다. 침구 및 웰컴푸드, 어메너티 등 모두 좋습니다. 침구는 국내로 따지면 씨마크 급은 아니지만 적어도 라카이 정도는 됩니다. 침대 사이즈가 상당히 큽니다. 성인남녀, 여아2명 이 자기에는 조금은 작은 정도입니다. (퀸사이즈 두개를 붙인거라고 보시면 됩니다.) 날씨가 춥고, 코로나바이러스때문에 수영장을 이용하지 않았습니다만.. 다들 재미나게 이용하시는거 같습니다. 조식은 평이 다 좋듯이, 깔끔하게 잘 나옵니다. 쌀국수, 반미 등 여러 메뉴가 준비되어있고 음식 8가지 정도가 매일 바뀝니다. 저녁은 비추천 합니다. 가격은 그렇게 비싸지 않으나 뗏기간이라 그런지 음식이 너무 늦게 나옵니다. 다만, 맛은 어느정도 보장되어 있습니다. 룸서비스로 시키는 음식은 베트남 물가대비 비싸지만 한국대비 저렴합니다. 그리고 맛도 괜찮습니다. 전자레인지를 빌려주는 걸로 알고있었는데, 전자레인지를 대신 돌려다주는 구조입니다. 그리고 그 시간도 상당히 오래걸리고 상태도 별로입니다. 전자레인지 사용을 한번 고려하시길 바랍니다. (햇반을 주면 햇반을 자기네들이 돌려서 가져다주는 구조입니다.) 아코야 마사지(호텔마사지)는 3명이 이용했는데, 평이 다 별로였습니다. 인당 9만원 정도 되는데 해당 가격이면 다른곳에서 두번 받는걸 추천합니다. 피트니스룸 깨끗하고 기구도 여럿 있습니다. 이용객도 적고 수건도 준비되어 있습니다. 이야기하면 자전거도 대여해줍니다. 전체적으로 가격은 상당히 비싼편이지만, 그만한 값어치는 하는 호텔입니다."

However, the cleanliness could be improved - we found a live cockroach in the bedroom upstairs on the 2nd day and another dead one in the living room on the 3rd day. The fixtures in the rooms should be properly maintained as well - we ve got a leaking ceiling in both the rooms on level 1 on separate occasions, and spoilt plugs and etc. The wall separating our villa and the next one was too low so we often hear partying noises from our neighbours at night after 10pm as they were partying in the pool.

Hội An,Riverside Impression Villa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",11/04/2016,Very relaxing stay here. Hotel is situated on an island about 10 minutes walk from the market and 20 from the japanese bridge. Great to walk in and get a taxi back for about 1. The small garden at the hotel is full of the most beautiful bonsai trees and slopes down to the river where you can watch the locals fishing and getting on with their daily lives. The only downside was the breakfast. This takes patience but as you sit on a covered terrace in the garden looking out at the river it isn t too much of a hardship. You do have to pay for all the extras here - no complimentary bottles of water and although there was a kettle in the room there was no tea or coffee provided. On check in we were given so much information to help us during our stay and safety advice too - you felt they really cared about you. There are only 6 rooms here so you really get the personal touch.
Hội An,Riverside Impression Villa,Traveloka,Dave,"10,0",10/05/2016,"We arrived from da nang after a long day at the marble mountains followed by an awful taxi journey (avoid the taxi issue by booking a transfer with the hotel direct - just over half the price of a taxi from da nang). So we were a little worn out and agitated by the time we were greeted by some very friendly members of staff / owner. Within 2 minutes of being in this property, we had smiles on our faces and felt completely relaxed!! having settled into our large, clean room, (we d paid the little extra to have a river view and it s so worth it! (the views and sounds on a morning and during the day made it the best stay on our travels... Oh we had lightening one evening too!)) we were summoned downstairs and given a briefing on what to do and what not to do whilst in hoi an. We thought this was going to turn out to be a sales pitch but it wasn t! a brilliant touch. Hoi an, was a little overhyped and touristy if i m being honest... The famous saying same same but different must have been invented here. It was still a nice enough place to visit for a couple of days, there s the river and town with the markets nearby. A million chances to have dresses and suits made to measure. There s also a couple of beaches within 20 minutes cycling distance. The roads aren t as bad as some places in vietnam, so it s safe even for a novice. Bikes are available at the property. If you have 4 spare days and a couple of good books, the garden here is all you d need. So beautiful and peaceful."

Photos are definitely outdated/misleading -- the outdoor area was pretty nice but the room left a lot to be desired. Definitely needs a deep clean particularly the bathroom and ac units. Lots of mold in the shower (curtain was gross tbh) and in the vents - smelled like mildew and we eventually had to turn off the ac in the main bedroom bc it was giving us breathing issues. Beds/linens were fine, and we were out and about most of the day so it was tolerable but we definitely wouldn t stay here again. It was very cheap so i guess in a sense you get what you pay for? it could ve been worse, but also could ve been a lot better especially based on the photos."

It is an easy walk into town. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The ac worked great and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast included breads, fruit, and cook to order eggs, pancakes and other food. The staff was very helpful in recommending specific tours, restaurants and coffee shops.

Room is large and clean. As per the photos, the shower / toilet are separated from the bedroom by a frosted glass which might be off putting for some. Breakfast option and dining room are great. It includes a small buffet as well as made to order eggs, pancakes. The lady at the reception is very savvy about everything in hoi an. Lovely to relax by the pool. Definitely recommend this boutique hotel versus cheaper options available in the new part of hoi an town."

Hội An,Riverside White House Boutique Hotel,Traveloka,Gregg,"10,0",10/04/2024,"This was a great experience for me. The hotel is small...i think 11 rooms...and it sits right on the river with a walking path (paved) along the river that leads to the old market in hoi an. The staff...well, i would marry them if i could. They were such a delight and were so helpful to me in finding restaraunts, optometrist, and motorcycle rental at a moments notice. Free breakfast every morning, which was always followed by me sitting in the outdoor eating area and watching the boats going by. And the most touching part...when it was time for me to go to the airport, my ride showed up and the staff followed me out to the car and said goodbye."
Hội An,Riverside White House Boutique Hotel,Traveloka,Mark,"10,0",15/04/2024,"Just under a month in vietnam this was our favorite hotel in nine ncities for several reasons. The location is direct riverfront and at night all the tourist boats cruise up and down the river all lit up with multicolored lights. The patio is a great place for sipping drinks day or night. Every employee we interacted with was so friendly and helpful. Breakfast team will custom cook you just about anything you want and do it well. Front desk hein is a joy to be around will help you book all your needs. Hotel owner loi is a hands on multifaceted individual who is repairing a light fixture one minute and making you an amazing frozen drink the next and always with a smile. Our room was a large attic unit facing the river with a great high walled walk out balcony. Great a/c, hot water. I have nothing negative to say about my stay. Every day was fantastic. Highly recommend."

Hội An,Roxana River Villa,Traveloka,Melissa,"6,0",06/03/2023,"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The property is relatively well kept and a bonus is that it s by the river - i would suggest paying the extra money for the view. We came across issues with the ac for 2 of the 3 rooms i booked. I ended up swapping my room 3 times during our 3 night stay. A few things to note, there are no elevators so you have to be comfortable climbing stairs, and the breakfast buffet is a la carte. I selected roxana because my preference is to stay somewhere quieter and away from the busy streets but you will have to walk about 3km to get to the old town. They do offer bikes and the reception can help with ordering an electric car which is perfect for families/larger groups. However, it s difficult to order a cab at night (after 8pm) cause they re typically all booked up. Overall my family and i had a great stay at roxana river villas."
Hội An,Roxana River Villa,Traveloka,Henry,"10,0",31/03/2020,"We stayed at the roxana river villa in hoi an, vietnam in early march, our large room had a balcony overlooking the riverfront giving us views of the occasional boat traffic. The entire hotel is very clean and well maintained. The pool area is mostly shaded, a plus in the tropical heat, and large enough to swim laps. Yet, the best part of our stay was the interacting with the very friendly and kind staff. They were a pleasure to speak with and always looking out for our needs. For breakfast there was a variety of food and always very good. The roxana also provides bicycles for guest use, which came in very handy to ride into the old quarter, which was approximately one kilometer away. This was far enough for a little peace and quiet from the tourist noise, but within walking, or biking distance. We highly recommend the roxana river villa for any stay in the hoi an area."
Hội An,Roxana River Villa,Traveloka,Jilly,"8,0",21/02/2020,This is a charming place to stay. A new hotel overlooking the river it is situated just a short walk from the main town.

Hội An,Rural Scene Villa,Traveloka,Michelle,"10,0",28/03/2020,Loved everything about this place. Location was great - a bit out of town but loved to see local life. The room was big and very clean. The breakfast was amazing - freshly cooked to order (try the banana pancakes) bikes are provided which we used daily to cycle into town and to the beach. The service from the staff was brilliant - nothing was too much trouble. The only slight thing to be aware of is the pool loses the sun at lunchtime.
Hội An,Rural Scene Villa,Traveloka,matthew,"10,0",08/11/2016,This place is so beautifully decorated and brand new. It s even nicer than the pictures show. I booked 4 nights and ended up staying for 2 weeks. Everything was amazing from the comfortable bed to the rainfall shower in the bathroom. The staff were truly amazing. So friendly and genuine. The food that they cook is delicious and they are so kind and helpful. It is a little far from the old city so i would recommend renting a scooter but it is not absolutely necessary as they have free bikes and a golf cart that they will drive you into town for free. I highly recommend staying here as you will feel like home and it will be hard to leave this wonderful place. Thank you for a great stay!!! 10 stars )
Hội An,Rural Scene Villa,Traveloka,Vimla,"10,0",13/10/2016,"Anybody who comes to hoi an should stay here. I booked for 4 nights and ended up staying for the location of the homestay is very tranquil - it was a haven after leaving the busy streets of hanoi. I had amazing views of the pool, palm trees and river from my room. The room itself is amazing. It s spacious, comfortable and clean with a fantastic bathroom and very tastefully decorated. The family is extremely friendly and helpful. They are genuinely kind and are passionate about the service that they deliver. Most of my interactions were with sol who is an absolute star. She arranged tours for me, made sure i was comfortable at all times, arranged transportation for me to and from the ancient town and basically went out of her way to ensure that i had a memorable time. When i moved to spend a few days at the beach they even took me to the new location at no cost. In addition to this sol took me on a tour around hoi an and when the family heard that i wanted to go on a basket boat ride it was quickly arranged for me. My stay at rural scene villa was by far my best stay anywhere in south east asia. After a very delightful week here i felt like i was leaving old friends. The beautiful location, fantastic rooms, genuinely warm family and excellent value for money makes it a perfect choice for your visit to hoi an. Stay here when you are in hoi an, you will not regret it!"

If you wish to go to the center of hoi an the hotel has an electric car that will drive you there in a few quick minutes. We choose to walk to central hoi an a few times or road the bikes which we rented from the hotel. It was nice walking/riding through cam nam because it was a local neighborhood with no tourists, which was a nice contrast to when we crossed the bridge into old town hoi an which is beautiful but full of tourists.

Hội An,Rural Scene Villa,Traveloka,Molly,"10,0",21/11/2016,Amazing stay here. The villa is super clean and comfortable. The staff are very helpful and informative. The villa itself is a little bit out of the town but we easily rented bikes from the villa everyday. It was a nice 10-15 min ride into town. It was definitely worth it to stay out of the busy town and relax in this peaceful villa!
Hội An,Santa Sea Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Tuomo,"10,0",17/12/2019,"Ei oikeastaan mitään negatiivistä, kaikki toimi moitteetta. Kaikissa huoneissa ei ole parveketta, ainoastaan meren puoleisissa, joten otettiin korotus siihen. Tässä huonessa olikin iso jääkaappi ja ym ruoanteko vehkeet, liesi jne..jos niitä tarvitsisi. Allas on pienehkö, mutta riittävä. Aamupala perus ok. Itse alue on loistava, hiljainen(ainakin low season aikaan), kuppiloita löytyy, meri ihan rannassa. Aallot oli turhan kovat tähän aikaan vuodesta(marraskuu). Taxi vanhaan kaupunkiin alle 100.000 dong 4 . Pari kertaa päivässä, aamu ja iltapäivä hotskun ilmainen kuljetus vanhaan kaupunkiin.

Our stay here made us forget about all of the others. I wanted to change the room location to an ocean view--no problem. The breakfasts were adequate, with a choice between any style eggs and traditional pho bo which was very good. Fresh fruits were picked from their own plants. Beach facilities were available. The staff was always extremely helpful with any request, and always very friendly with a pleasant smile. Would recommend it to anyone, anytime. We will be coming back."

Hội An,Santa Sea Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Jackie,"8,0",08/09/2019,"Lovely new hotel. Clean, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast. Beach across road with free sun beds. Hotel pool small but we enjoyed it. The housekeeping ladies, reception girl and the breakfast waitress are the best! so friendly, always helpful. We stayed three weeks and better aircon would have made for a more comfortable stay. It was not adequate to cool room and given it doesn t run if you re not in the room (as it requires your electronic key to turn on power in room) it would take a while to cool the room and struggled to keep it cool enough. Given the price the aircon should be on as required. Even our us 20 a night homestay kept our aircon running to provide a cool room. The only other minor issue was the guy at reception kept losing our key (which they want handed in when you leave the hotel). But he was distracted most of the day by his phone. I d definately return and highly recommend if you want a relaxing hotel by the beach."

Hội An,Santa Sea Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Tim,"10,0",17/09/2018,"Santa villa is a silent hotel - reasonably new - the room we had was a super deluxe(?) with its own balcony with a view of the beach. Very comfortable room and bed - everything was spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. Breakfast was acceptable with eggs anyway you like, toast and pastries , juice. I d didn t like the coffee (very strong) they served and also didn t try cereals as the milk was in a jug with no cooling (so hot it would quickly spoil in my view) but very minor negatives. We used the hotel car service to get us to the airport - everything was efficient and we were well looked after. At the moment there is construction work on a building opposite so a little noisy from 7 30am and if you re sensitive to that i would recommend asking to be on the other side of the hotel hotel has its own beach sun loungers and umbrellas - we happened to use the ones from the pine bar - which are the ones closest to be sea - all you need to do is buy drinks from them and they are ok for you to use them."

Các phòng rất đẹp và phòng tắm rộng rãi như nhau. Chủ sở hữu rất thân thiện và hữu ích. Nơi này vẫn còn mới, vì vậy đó là một lợi thế. Thực đơn cho bữa sáng cũng rất ngon và họ thực sự thích nó khi bạn yêu cầu các món ăn địa phương không có trong thực đơn. Họ sẽ mua hoặc chuẩn bị nó cho bạn - chúng tôi thực sự đã thử giá vé của gia đình họ vào một buổi sáng và điều đó thực sự tốt. Sinh tố trái cây nếm thực sự tốt. Món phở bò ngon nhất tôi từng nếm cũng xuống đường. Khu vườn homestay cũng khá yên bình. Đó là 4km (15-20 phút) từ phố cổ hội an, nhưng chúng tôi đã ở đó cho bãi biển, vì vậy lý tưởng của nó.

Rồi hôm sau mình có mượn con dao để gọt xoài ăn thì đem ra cho mình đĩa đựng và khăn giấy. Phòng óc thoải mái, sạch sẽ và ấm cúng. Phong cách phòng kiểu tường gạch cổ cổ lạ lạ. Đồ ăn sáng ngon và vừa khẩu vị người miền nam như mình (do trước đó có ăn ngoài và thấy đồ ăn bị mặn so với vị mình ăn). Trước khi check out về mình còn được tặng chai nước suối bự để đi dọc đường. Chắc chắn mình sẽ quay lại lần nữa."

Hội An,Senvila Boutique Resort,Traveloka,Edie,"10,0",26/07/2018,"The resort is quite a distance away from the old town/markets but there s a shuttle(more like a buggy) from/to the hotel few time a day and you can also call a grab(which is exactly like an uber) or rent a bike/scooter so the distance didn t really bother us at all. The pool is open from 7am to 7pm, in which my friend and i spent most of our time as it was extremely hot/humid during the day. One of the best parts was that the whole staff including the booking manager ms.ngan was incredibly kind and supportive! )"

Tôi đã đi và trải nghiệm rất nhiều địa điểm , ở hội an cũng rất nhiều nhưng lần đầu tiên tôi cảm thấy rất khó chịu, bức xúc vì 1 số tiền nhỏ - và đó là tiền giữ xe ô tô. Ks này không có bãi đậu xe, xe tôi đậu ở nhà dân cách đó 10m và có thu phí 40k. Số tiền không nhiều so với chuyến đi nhưng nó làm chuyến đi của tôi có trải nghiệm rất tệ.

You get a good breakfast at the hotel and the staff is service minded and can help with anything you need. The beds are hard but then they are in asia. I slept well.

You could very easily hear hall noise, and even the door unlocking next door. Luckily my neighbours were quiet, but you could hear even a basic conversation in the next room. Breakfast was good.

Hội An,Silk Sense Hoi An River Resort,Traveloka,Guillaume,"4,0",08/09/2025,"We stayed at silk sense for a week with our 20-month-old. The setting is quiet and pleasant, and staff were consistently kind and helpful. However, safety and problem-solving fell short for a 5-star hotel. On arrival we found our room had a raised platform and stairs information not disclosed at booking and unsuitable with a toddler. After the first night the baby cot broke, waking our daughter we later saw four exposed, rusty screws. The replacement arrived without a mattress (a folded comforter was used), and when we asked again we were told no proper cot was available. The hotel then bought a newborn cot with sides only 50 cm high easy to climb out of especially risky with stairs in the room. We changed to a room without stairs, but it was a clear downgrade from what we booked.

Hotellet ligger i et stille område. Der er ca 6 km ind til hoi an og ca 2 km til an bang strand. Hotellet har en gratis shuttle bus til begge stedet flere gange om dagen. Tager du en taxa til hoi an koster det ca 100.000 dong inkl tip. Du kan låne cykler gratis. Morgenmaden er god (både østlig og vestlig mad) med et stort udvalg. Lørdag aften har hotellet grill skewer i restauranten. Det viste sig at være en lækker seafood buffet. Poolen var ren og indbydende. Personalet var imødekommende og hjælpesomme. Sense spa var fantastisk. Jeg var der 3 gange vi fik vouchers til både afternoon tea og fod massage. Alt i alt et fantastisk ophold.

So first impression is soso. And we had meal at the hotel on saturday evening cuz they have sea food buffet but it was terrible. There was only some small foods that i can serve by my self but defenielty all is from the mornig meal served for free. Not the new one. And the sea foods are not that many and doesnt look fresh. I ordered 10 pcs of shrimp but they only served 4 or 5 pcs. I dont know why. The woman staff was not that kind. She didnt served source for fish. If it should be served by us they shoudl let ys know. Anyways it doesnt look good resorts food at all. We paid a lots for that dinner. My paresnts very disappointed and me either.we were said. And the other morning(17.june) another woman staff at the restaurnat was very unkind. She was almost yelling me for my pose at the chair. I am not the kids and i was your customer at tge luxury resort. I cant beleive it. I wonder why they dont educate fot service to their staff. This resort is not that cheap at all for me. I am sorry but i dont want rr ommed here to anyone. But the staffs at the lobby. They were good and theur service level is quite good. They tried help me all the ways. And the spa was also good.

Hội An,Silk Sense Hoi An River Resort,Traveloka,Nicky,"10,0",24/07/2024,"Such a lovely resort. Vu the man at reception who helped us with our bags, made our stay very personal by memorising our names. The only downside of our stay was when a company held a gala at the hotel and all the attendees were very loud, obnoxious and rude. The loud music was blaring across the pool and then all the attendees flooded into the pool area and it became very busy. We saw attendees spitting and blowing their nose in the pool, which was quite unappealing. The hotel staff just watched on and did not calm the noise or behaviour. This was unfortunate as we planned to have a pool day which was unexpectedly ruined. In the future i think the hotel would benefit from informing their guests when such corporate events will be happening and they tend to take over the hotel and make facilities unusable for other guests. Apart from that we had an amazing stay and would definitely recommend."

Definitely recommend eating the vietnamese dishes. The only thing we didn t like was that the tours booked through the hotel were a lot more expensive than if you just book them through klook. We made the mistake of booking several of our day tours through the hotel for convenience sake. However, do check with the staff, on the last day, they offer to price match whatever we found online but you need to pull up the quotes on the phone for confirmation."

This is pretty common for all hotels in southeast asia under a hundred bucks a night. This place cost me around 40 per night, so it s something i expected. I recently got back from an eight week vacation/holiday, and i stayed at roughly ten different locations. This was by far the best hotel involved. I had a checkout for noon, and my flight was at midnight. The front desk took great care of my luggage, securing it so that i could enjoy hoi an for my last day. They even offered to let me shower in an open room, and mind you this was after i checked out. Needless to say the staff went above and beyond from my perspective as an ardent traveler.

Breakfast was also top notch. The one bit of feedback i would provide (and did) to the property was that the odor of mildew/mold in the 2 rooms we had and the presence of black mold around the bathroom fan were problematic.

Hội An,Silkotel Hoi An,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",02/08/2019,Very nice hotel. Very helpful staff with good english. Our room faced north and about 7am the speakers and the neighbouring temple started. Manager quickly offered me a room change to which i declined mainly because i couldn t be bothered packing up my stuff. As such i can t deem this to be a negative about the hotel. It is just one of those things. The next morning the speakers didn t make any noise. The room was of a large size with a very comfy bed. Curtains needed to be a bit darker but i didn t mind getting up with the sun. Air con in our room struggled a bit but in a friend s room it was like a fridge so not sure what to make of that. Breakfast was of high quality.

Hội An,Smart Garden Homestay,Traveloka,Nguyen T. T.,"5,0",09/08/2024,"Lúc vào ở đi ra đi vào báo gì phụ thu. Sáng dậy báo phụ thu. Mình không bảo là không trả. Chỉ hỏi sao lúc vào không báo trước. Bên đó bảo là tại chị không ở nhà. Con chị không biết. Không biết sao ngồi làm lễ tân check-in cho khách vậy. Rồi bảo đây là lỗi bên chị. Nhưng vẫn đòi tiền phụ thu. Mình im lặng chờ e trai mình lên lấy hành lý thì bên đó nói giọng rất khó nghe. Sau đó con trai chạy ra bảo là tưởng mình là lái xe nên không báo trong khi mình là người đưa cccd để check-in. Rồi to tiếng nói ở thì phải trả tiền đó là quy định. Mình bảo mình là khách chứ phải kinh doanh nghành này đâu mà biết quy định, mình cũng không bảo không trả tiền phụ thu. Chỉ nhắc bên home là đáng ra phải báo trước để khách biết. Xong đứa con trai nổi khùng bảo chú đặt chú phải biết rồi to tiếng đòi nhảy ra đánh mình rồi tranh cãi qua lại . Nói chung là tệ ))) trong khi không ai bảo là không trả tiền phụ thu. Xe đạp cho thuê thì đi hỏng giữa đường"

Sát biển nên rất tiện để tận hưởng không gian thoáng mát. 1 lưu ý nhỏ cho khách là các chai dầu gội sữa tắm bằng gốm, nắp đậy hoặc không chặt hoặc trơn, nếu không chú ý trẻ con sẽ làm bể. Bé nhà mình tưởng chai nhựa nên lúc cầm sơ ý tuột tay làm bể, đền hết 400k. Mọi người lưu ý tránh nguy hiểm và mất tiền không đáng có nhen. Có thể do trời mưa lớn nên ban công không kịp thoát nước.

Lúc check out kiểm phòng bảo nhà mình có dùng bia trong tủ lạnh và mất một đôi dép. Không đáng bao nhiêu nhưng vì nhà mình không có dùng, nên không đồng ý thanh toán.

Hội An,Soluna D'Annam - The Art of Hoi An Relaxation,Traveloka,Hin Cheung,"6,0",21/03/2025,"Hoi an babylon luxury hotel spa (newly built) and hoi an babylon riverside spa (quite old) are sited side by side. We have booked 2 rooms and 2 nights for former hotel. The two hotels share one reception counter. We checked in at night and we were provided a room from the older hotel. We found out the mistake next morning and asked for relocation to the newer hotel that we booked and paid for. Hotel reception agreed to relocate us to babyon luxury (new one) on 2nd day, but the experience from first night was very bad. Equipments from the old hotel are pretty shabby, very strong wind from air conditioner was blowing right towards the bed. Even hotel staff couldn t adjust the wind power or direction. This made us very difficult to fall asleep on the 1st night. The experience on 2nd night is much better at the newer hotel."

Hội An,Son Hoi An Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Alexandros,"10,0",06/03/2025,Beautiful property within walking distance (easy 10-15 minute leisurely stroll) to hoi an old town. Hotel offers a shuttle but the shuttle can t get in the old town (for obvious reasons) so you still need to walk a little to get to town. Staff were very attentive and polite. Hotel has lots of beautiful colours and is furnished impressively. Breakfast was good too! the hotel has a common area used for ironing where you can find 2 weak irons and 2 ironing boards but maybe they can start allowing irons in the rooms in the future. Nonetheless i had an amazing stay at the hotel.

Tvärs över hotellet köpte vi en dagsutflykt och beställde taxi till flygplatsen, allt gick väldigt smidigt. Här sydde de även upp tre väskor enl bild vi hade med oss, vi blev jättenöjda och billigare än i stan. Vi rekommenderar verkligen detta fina hotell till andra gäster!"

Her er ro, charme og en helt særlig varme, som gør, at man føler sig hjemme med det samme. Det hyggelige, intime hotel skabte en cozy stemning fra første øjeblik, og det hele blev løftet af personalet som var exceptionelt venlige og hjælpsomme. Lige fra receptionen og dørmanden til poolpasseren og personalet i køkkenet mødte vi smil, overskud og ægte imødekommenhed. En særlig stor ros skal lyde til morgenmadsbuffeten. Vi havde ikke forventet noget særligt fra et så lille sted, men vi blev virkelig positivt overraskede både udvalg og kvalitet var i top. Vi vil helt klart anbefale dette hotel til alle, der ønsker at opleve hoi an med nærvær, charme og afslappet luksus."

Hội An,Son Hoi An Boutique Hotel & Spa,Traveloka,Berna,"6,0",22/04/2025,The hotel is 15 min walk from hoi an ancient town center which was the main reason we choose to stay here.

The flooding was only 5-10inches deeper where the hotel was most of the road was wet but not as flooded. So many tourist had booked this boutique hotel and we were all trapped having to order a cab whenever we wanted to leave. My original booking was incorrect (2 twins instead of a king?) you can hear everything, the water didn t stay warm longer than 5 mins. Just really really unfortunate and i hope they fix this issue. Oh yea no elevator and no one helps you bring your luggage up. I would have gladly paid for that."

For breakfast you have a great choice of meals which you can order from a menu. There is unlimited coffee (as one of the reviews before had queried) and fresh fruits and juice is served complimentary as well. The management is well organized, very friendly and warm-hearted. She spoke english very well and was able to answer every question about hoi an, its history and its surroundings. Our room (double queen, balcony, city view) was very modern, perfectly clean and even had a rain shower. The hotel offers bikes and motorbikes (scooters) upon request and the staff can also recommend great tours to explore hoi an and its beautiful surroundings.

Hội An,Song Thiện Homestay,GoogleMap,Kim Chi,"10,0",10/10/2023,"We were provided with fruit on arrival which was lovely. Our rooms and bathrooms we re extremely clean. The triple room with balcony was so spacious although it was too hot to be on the balcony. Room had aircon, fridge, tv and hairdryer. Kettle if requested. Iron and iron board for use downstairs. Guests are requested to take their shoes off at the main entrance. Slippers are provided to walk to and from your room. Friendly helpful staff who advised me the hotel is only one year old. Breakfast is available at a cost. Daily housekeeping. Hotel is near night market. We rented bicycles from the hotel for 30k each a day. However they were not so new. You can ride all the way to an bang beach. Other parts of hoi an is walkable and i believe grab is available. Hotel offers tours. Hotel arranged for 7 seater car to danang airport for 350k. Hotel laundry service is 30k per kg. We used and recommend mr b tattoo across the alley if you re looking for one. Boat ride on the river is 200k for 4 people. About 20 minutes which takes you up and down the river. The lanterns are extra and sold by the ladies along the river and i believe also available for purchase on the boat. Our boat driver took some excellent photos for us. We did it at night when everything is lit up. For local food i recommend and see my reviews - thịt nướng cô lợi hội an - ốp la đông - cafe muối cô anh - also try bánh mì sum and madam khanh suggestion for hotel provide room hand towels"

Hän halusi vilpittömästi kertoa ja neuvoa vietnamilaisen ja hoianin tarjontaan. Käytiin esim. Yhdessä syömässä katukeittiöissä hänen kanssaan. Huone oli siisti ja tilava. Sänky vietnamilaiseen tapaan kova. Vaikka niin sanotusti hiljaisemmalla kadulla niin korvatulpat nukkuessa. Homestayn sijainti oli hyvä.

Breakfast is freshly prepared as you want it. Passion fruit juice is lovely. Very friendly owner who really goes out of her way to help.

We did however get a room with a fake window (facing and interior wall) which we did not fancy, but besides this, the room was perfectly fine. The hotel is situated quite a distance from hoi an old town and though it can be reached on foot it is an inconvenience. It can be a bit hard to find a restaurent for lunch/dinner in the area cause the choises are rather limited."

We had a couple of issues which were attended to so promptly. When we checked in, we had a few mosquitoes in the room. We mentioned it to front desk and within a minute, a lady was equipped with insect repellant our toilet block twice, mostly my 5year old s fault though. This isn t his first (nor last) toilet he ll block unfortunately ( not only did housekeeping unblocked it for us ever so quickly, they even cleaned disinfected it before leaving. Pool was marvellous, so clean blue! breakfast was just what we needed to start the day. Variety made to order noodle omelette station available. There is construction currently in progress next door it was the view we had from one of our windows. We had already known about this from previous reviews was holding our breathe when there were sets of earplugs provided on the bedside lol! but wasn t even an issue. Didn t hear anything loud enough to even get a mention, think they re past that loud stage. Staff arranged a birthday day cake for my son, we were so surprised and touched. All the staff knew it was his birthday and greeted him as they went past, felt like we were with family )"

They have free bikes to use too. The included breakfast was decent, but there were a few small cockroaches that scurried across my table. I guess it s normal in this part of the world though. The room was nice, clean."
Hội An,TTC Hotel - Hoi An,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",09/03/2019,"The hotel looks modern and clean. The swimming pool is decent and not too crowded. The breakfast is pretty good as well. That being said, we found cockroaches there in our room -- in the bathroom to be specific. The staff used pesticide in our room but after that, we found another one. We did not change the room because other rooms seem to have cockroaches as well. Also, the bathroom floor was very slippery when it was wet -- the manager gave us flip flops, which was okay. The constructions in both sides of the hotel were noisy, but it wasn t too bad we used the pool at around noon, and the noise was bothersome a bit, but tolerable. Overall we enjoyed our stay there, even though we were concerned about the cockroaches. But it seems like other hotels have similar problems, except for (maybe) top tier hotels like hyatt."
Hội An,TTC Hotel - Hoi An,GoogleMap,Don,"6,0",19/03/2019,"It s a noisy hotel because the pool is in the centre so when kids are in the pool or anyone loud, you can hear throughout the property.

Hội An,TTC Hotel - Hoi An,GoogleMap,Michael,"10,0",11/04/2019,"Great staff and amazing property. You can t tell from the outside, but the inside is the tropical oasis. The only complaint i have with the hotel is the cleanliness of the tub in our king deluxe suite. There was a rubber mat on the bottom of the tub. I notice it a little further away from the showerhead than i normally like it, so i picked it up and tried to move it. Well, it seems like no one has done that in a while, because underneath the mat had what looked like months of grime and gunk built up. The rest of the hotel seemed very clean, but there was just this one spot which really grossed me out."

We enjoyed biking around hoi an with the bikes the hotel provided. In addition, when we first arrived, we sat and talked about things to do, how to avoid being overpaying, and a great tailor shop. The breakfast offered had a huge variety and delicious. The room was clean and spacious. They work hard to keep everything cleaned on a daily basis. There was construction next door and they apologize and offered to change our room if it bothered us but we were out and about during the day and it stopped by late afternoon so didn t affect our stay whatsoever. The hotel booked two tours for us which we found were better priced then the ones offered elsewhere. We are not the type to book with hotels and usually preferred to find our own way. We did a market walk, cooking class, and bamboo boat tour for 23/pp. Also, they arranged transportation for free to visit my son sanctuary and we only had to price the entrance fee ( 7.50/pp) followed by a boat and lunch. We loved food accommodating and helpful everyone was. I would whole heartedly recommend staying here with visiting hoi an."

Staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was pretty good, and wi-fi was strong but sometimes spotty. Location was very good, just 5 minutes walking to the super-touristy old quarter. Only downside was that all rooms are probably quite noisy, due to the way the hotel is built it was tolerable while we were there because nobody used the swimming pool (too cold and rainy everyday), but i can easily imagine during the summer this being a real issue."

She said she would speak to the staff and have the room cleaned again. The cleaners did attempt another clean, but when we returned in the afternoon, the offensive plaster was still there! they had the photo - there s no excuse for leaving it behind a second time! incredibly disappointed.

I was upgraded to a very spacious deluxe room, and a (small) downside was that the air-conditioner in the large room wasn t very effective in cooling down the room, but thankfully the weather wasn t too warm. Also, the television did not have international/english channels (e.g., cnn, bbc). The front reception staff are outstanding (emily, the manager, and her colleagues). They will learn your name and take the time to chat with you. If you have any questions or requests (e.g., booking of bus/train tickets, etc.), they are more than happy to assist.

The location was pretty perfect, just a short walk away from most anything in the old city. The negatives have been mentioned by people already, the hotel is right on kind of a busy road, so it s not the most quiet location. Also within the hotel is a little loud as sound carries through to the room. So if you want to sleep in, this may not be the best hotel for you.

The hotel is clean and the rooms generous. Good selection for breakfast too! others have made mention that the hotel is situated on a busy road and is therefore loud etc. To give you a better understanding before you book or get turned off, yes, the hotel is located on a main street. But, you will find busier more louder streets staying in and around hanoi or hcmc. We didn t observe any noise from our room and we stayed there for two nights! we didn t find hoi an to be ridiculously busy compared to other cities in vietnam. I will also mention the tailor promoted through the hotel. I had ordered one suit to be made and a blazer. The girls there are amazing! they know there stuff! i fell in love with my suit and blazer so much so that i had another suit made and two additional blazers! i will definitely be ordering more in future through them and have them ship it to me in australia. Oh and don t forget to try the white rose dumplings in the food court in the day market.

I had to call a number to get someone to come around. Also, staff did not understand any english. For a holiday rental this is not acceptable. The room and bathroom was clean and no issues there. A bottle of water in the fridge would have helped and a bit more closet space."

Hội An,The House 36,Traveloka,Truc L.,"6,4",16/08/2018,"Dịch vụ rất tệ. Căn phòng sạch sẽ nhưng thiếu kem đánh răng, bàn chải đánh răng và q-tip. Chúng tôi trở về từ phố cổ hội an về nhà lúc 9 giờ tối, nhưng ông lão phụ trách trông coi nhà và mở cửa cho khách vào ban đêm đang ngủ nên anh ta không vui khi thấy chúng tôi rằng muộn muộn và nói với chúng tôi rằng anh ấy vẫn ổn để mở cửa cho chúng tôi nhưng nó sẽ làm gián đoạn giấc ngủ của anh ấy và khiến anh ấy cảm thấy mệt mỏi. Sau đó vào buổi tối khi chúng tôi chuẩn bị ngủ, chúng tôi phát hiện ra rằng căn phòng thiếu bàn chải và kem đánh răng nên tôi nói với người đàn ông và anh ta cố gắng tìm kiếm khắp nơi trong nhà để tìm bàn chải đánh răng cho chúng tôi. Sau đó anh ấy không thể tìm thấy nó và tôi đã phải đến một cửa hàng gần đó để mua bàn chải đánh răng. Sáng hôm sau, anh họ tôi hỏi nhân viên tiếp tân xem họ có bàn chải và kem đánh răng hay không nhưng cô ấy chỉ trả lời rằng họ đã hết những thứ đó và tiếp tục sử dụng máy tính, thậm chí không cố gắng giúp chúng tôi hay nói xin lỗi. Bàn chải đánh răng và kem đánh răng không đắt tiền nhưng tôi nghĩ chúng là cơ bản của sự tiện nghi trong phòng. Căn phòng có hai loại chăn một loại rất dày và một loại rất mỏng. Tuy nhiên, spa bên cạnh nhà là tốt. Tôi nghĩ rằng ngôi nhà nên cố gắng cải thiện nếu họ không muốn mất khách hàng."

Mặc dù mình không dùng nhưng nghĩ đây là cái cơ bản phải có mà. Đèn hơi tối, gối cứng nên đau cổ. Một điều nữa là trong booking của mình có bao gồm bữa sáng. Nhưng đến sáng dậy mình hỏi thì không ai biết về điều này. Trong khi 7h mình đi tour và lúc mình hỏi là 6h30 rồi. Và mình phải tự túc ăn sáng. Tour cù lao chàm đắt hơn các chỗ khác khoảng 100k/pax.

Hội An,The Mansion Hoi An by Minova,Traveloka,Pham T. T.,"9,1",18/12/2019,"Nhân viên rất thân thiện và hỗ trợ khách hàng, phòng đẹp, giống hình, hơi nhỏ tuy nhiên dịch vụ tốt đã kéo lại rất nhiều. Mình ở phòng alex nên có free đưa tiễn sân bay hoặc vào đà nẵng. Nếu có dịp sẽ quay lại"
Hội An,The Mansion Hoi An by Minova,Traveloka,Yolan H.,"9,0",23/01/2020,"Thành thật mà nói, tôi cảm thấy giá phòng họ cung cấp quá cao. Nó giống như không ở trong một khách sạn một triệu rupiah mỗi đêm, mà ở trong một phòng khách (tốt đẹp) tại nhà của một người bạn. Vì chỉ có hai tầng và không có thang máy, tôi phải nâng chiếc vali 30kg của mình lên tầng 2 bằng cầu thang. Tôi không vui vì nhân viên phụ trách khách sạn lúc đó chỉ là một người phụ nữ nhỏ bé (rất thân thiện và hữu ích.) bên cạnh các phòng, lối vào và hồ bơi nhỏ có thể instagram, nhà của the mansion không được trang trí tốt. Vị trí cũng tương đối xa so với phố cổ hội an. Ngoài ra, khách sạn này không làm bạn thất vọng."

Hội An,The Moon River Homestay & Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Michael,"6,0",23/07/2025,The owners were very friendly and cooked you breakfast. The location is very hard for grab drivers to get to. Best to walk out to the main road to catch a grab ride.

Hội An,The Moon River Homestay & Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Naomi,"8,0",01/05/2017,"Clean, comfortable room in quiet and beautiful surrounds. The hosts, moon and tri, were fantastic and offered insights into the vietnamese culture and lifestyle. I was privileged to share a traditional vietnamese meal with them at one of their favourite restaurants. They also have a super cute dog. Free use of bicycles for commuting and transfers are easily organised through the hosts. They organised for a scooter with driver to take me to my son, and transfers between the accommodation and train station/airport. The location is in the village surrounded by farms which means it is quiet and, in my opinion, beautiful scenery. An bang beach is about 1km away and the town is about 2.5km away (short trips on the bicycle). The weather is hot so these trips might make you a hot, sweaty mess. Taxis or scooter transfers can be organised for a small fee. The bed was comfortable, the bedroom and bathroom were clean and included a fridge, tv, desk with chair and wardrobe. Basic toiletries are provided as in a hotel (toothbrush, comb, etc.) and the air conditioner worked well. There are both western and vietnamese breakfast options - try the cao lau it s delicious! all in all, it provided all the comforts of a hotel with a more personal touch through the interaction with the vietnamese hosts. Best suited for those seeking a more traditional insight to vietnamese life and a quiet place to stay. Those more inclined to party all night in town might be better off staying elsewhere."

The location is great, just 10-12 minutes by bicycle to the old town and 8 minutes to an bang beach. The vegetable village was tranquil, beautiful. The rooms were comfortable to stay in."
Hội An,The Moon River Homestay & Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Harry,"10,0",14/05/2017,"If you don t expect five-star-service, i can objectively recommend this place to you. It was one of my best choices ever. If i visit hoi an again, this homestay villa deserved to be my top-notch residence. Hosts were very kind, diligently maintained their facilities, and if you have any special request, they would find reasonable solution. And, last but not least, even though the location of the moon river villa is a little bit apart from the old town of hoi an (about 10 15 minutes by bicycle), but because of that you can see normal farming lives of local people and enjoy peaceful times."

Hội An,The Moon River Homestay & Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Zoella,"10,0",04/09/2017,"Our stay with tri and moon proved one of the leading highlights of our three week trip to vietnam and contributed much to our enjoyment of hoi an. Both were extremely welcoming and friendly throughout, offering helpful advice on what to see and where to go as well as answering our many questions. For a small fee they even shuttled us to and from their home during our evenings out, a real help as hoi an after dark is definitely not to be missed. We were initially checked into a room at the front of the house and while luxuriously comfy and clean (the beds in particular are unbelievably soft, as you ll find out!), our hosts very generously offered to move us to a room at the back of the property with views over the garden and river beyond. Overall, the house embodies a peaceful and serene feeling of intimacy that you just don t get with a hotel. Finally, i can t wrap this up without mention of tri and moon s offer to take us out early in the morning to enjoy an authentic vietnamese breakfast in their company. This was an absolutely brilliant experience and one of the many little touches that made our stay such a pleasant one. If we are ever in hoi an again - and we d love to return - we know where we ll be staying!!"

Hội An,The Moon River Homestay & Villa Hội An,Traveloka,Stella Marie,"10,0",07/06/2018,"Fantastisk hyggelig vertsskap som virkelig gikk inn for at jeg skulle ha det hyggelig. Jeg ble kjørt hit og dit på scooter (tri, far i huset dukket tilfeldigvis opp med scooteren hver gang jeg var på vei ut døra og tilbød å kjøre meg dit jeg skulle), og jeg ble fortalt en del om livet i den lokale landsbyen på veien. Jeg elsket at stedet lå litt vekk fra stranda, slik at jeg fikk en tur gjennom den hyggelige landsbyen og fikk se litt mer enn turiststrømmen nede ved stranda. Jeg dro alene sist, men nå gleder jeg meg til å ta med både kjæreste og tenåringsdatter for å besøke tri og moon igjen. Dette er virkelig et av de mest sjarmerende stedene jeg har bodd. Siste formiddagen jeg hadde i vietnam tok tri og moon meg med på frokost og kafé i hoi an - en fantastisk avslutning på et oppriktig hyggelig opphold."

Nhân viên dọn phòng không lịch sự, vào phòng không gõ cửa, mở cửa giống như muốn xông thẳng vào phòng khách dù đã nói có người trong phòng và không hề xin lỗi khi khách ra mở cửa. Chỉ khi mình gọi xuống lễ tân báo thì lễ tân mới xin lỗi mình nhưng lí do là nhân viên kiểm nhầm phòng ?? mình nghĩ nguyên tắc cơ bản là vào phòng phải gõ cửa chứ nhỉ. Dù nghĩ là không có khách nhưng thấy cửa khoá phải gõ để hỏi chứ ai lại mở cửa liên tục dồn dập như vậy ?? thật sự chưa bao giờ đi khách sạn nào ở hội an mà thất vọng như ở đây cả."

Dịch vụ tốt trước khi nhận phòng khoảng vài tiếng, lễ tân có gọi trước thông báo mình lúc tới thì các bạn mời nước rất chu đáo và còn nhiệt tình cho bọn mình bản đồ phố cổ, cũng như ghi chú một số địa điểm ăn nổi tiếng ở hội an. Phòng rất sạch sẽ, đầy đủ tiện nghi và chuyên nghiệp. Ở giữa toà có bể bơi ngay khi vào nhìn thấy, nhỏ nhưng xinh ạ, một vài người bơi là hợp lý, nếu nhiều quá cỡ 10 người thì bơi cùng 1 lúc thì có vẻ sẽ chật . Villa không quá gần phố cổ mà cách khoảng hơn 1 km, nhưng có cho khách mượn xe đạp miễn phí nên vẫn rất là ok. Bữa sáng ở đây không phải buffet đồ ăn, mà sẽ có danh sách đồ ăn cho khách lựa chọn trươc 1 món, còn chỉ có buffet hoa quả thôi.

Ăn sáng bufet cũng nhốn nháo không kém, sảnh phòng ăn thì rất rộng, nhưng dồn khách lấy đồ ăn vào một phòng bé tý, khách thì đông, đi lại gây va chạm chỉ sợ đổ vỡ. Đồ ăn sáng buffet còn ít chưa đa dạng so với tầm 1 khách sạn 4 , mong là khách sạn quan tâm đến những vấn đề dù nhỏ nhưng sẽ góp phần phát triển tốt hơn"

Trước khi đặt phòng mình có đọc được review của khách đã ở trước bảo là đồ ăn không phong phú với cả vì có lotte cinema ở đấy nên khách ra vào rất ồn. Mình có để ý thấy nhưng không biết vì sao mà lúc mình ở đồ ăn rất phong phú, đa dạng, hợp khẩu vị mình. Mình ở khu a nên cũng không rõ bên lotte có ồn không nhưng lúc mình di chuyển ra sảnh để chờ grab, thì chả thấy có ai mấy. Đại khái là mình thấy chỗ này đẹp nha, rất xứng đáng với giá tiền bỏ ra luôn ấy. Nhà mình cứ khen mãi thôi, chắc chắn mình sẽ trở lại ở nữa"
Hội An,The Pearl Hoi An,Traveloka,Nguyen B. L.,"8,5",23/08/2022,"Co bãi biển riêng, các dịch vụ ăn uống nhiều nhưng cho người hàn quốc là chủ yếu va đang chỉ mở 30 . Phòng đẹp, tiện đi hội an. Bể bơi thích hợp với trẻ em. Bên cạnh có rạp lotte. Tối resort tiết kiệm điện nên nhiều khi đường hơi mịt mờ. Buffet ok. Sẽ quay lại nếu đi hội an."
Hội An,The Pearl Hoi An,Traveloka,V Hng,"9,4",28/06/2022,"Nhân viên lễ tân check in khá chậm chạp vì resort vào mùa du lịch khá đông khách (rất nhiều khách đi theo đoàn). Sảnh check in và phòng ăn sáng không có điều hòa, quạt trần phe phẩy như đuổi ruồi. Vì check in lâu, lại không có điều hòa ở sảnh chờ nên thật sự mệt mỏi và chồng mình đã phát cáu lên đòi sang vin ở. Đây thật sự là điểm trừ lớn của resort. Ngoài vấn đề đó ra thì điểm cộng lớn là điện và điều hòa trong phòng 24/24 luôn, kể cả khi khách không có trong phòng đường truyền wifi tốt bể bơi ngoài trời đẹp và rộng bãi biển sạch, trong, thoai thoải (mỗi tội hôm mình bơi có sứa thì phải nên ai cũng bị rát rát, xót xót ở da khi tắm biển) cách phố cổ hội an khoảng 5km có lotte cinema ngay trong khu resort, lại vắng khách nên nhà mình bao nguyên cả phòng chiếu luôn. Ăn sáng thì miễn bàn vì mình thấy ăn sáng ở resort nào cũng dở như nhau. Nói chung nếu quay lại ha mình vẫn chọn citadine"
Hội An,The Pearl Hoi An,Traveloka,Dang,"9,4",01/09/2022,Dịch vụ và trải nghiệm thật sự tuyệt vời. Mình ưng nhất về bể bơi và biển ngay trong khu. Đồ ăn sáng không quá đa dạng nhưng vì gần khu phố cổ nên không có vấn đề gì. Ngoài ra khách sạn có xe đưa đón đến phố cổ theo các khung giờ. Nếu có lần sau thì the pearl vẫn sẽ là lựa chọn phù hợp cho những ai muốn đi nghỉ dưỡng.

Hội An,The Pearl Hoi An,Traveloka,Vu Hoang M.,"5,6",05/10/2022,"Citadines khá yên bình, đầy đủ dịch vụ phục vụ nghỉ dưỡng như spa, pool, tắm biển, beach bar (có phục vụ rượu), tuy nhiên có một số điểm khiến mình chỉ cho được 3 sao phòng ở view biển nhưng cách biển khá xa, chỉ có villa mới sát biển nhưng villa là bán nguyên căn cho khách chứ ít cho thuê nên tìm view biển khu pearl này gần như là không thể cửa ban công phòng mình (1343) bị hỏng, không đóng được mà ban công các phòng qua được nhau (ngăn bằng bồn cây chiều cao thấp). Mình đã báo lễ tân vì lo lắng về việc mất đồ và họ bảo kĩ thuật sửa nhưng khi quay lại thì mọi thứ vẫn y nguyên . May là không mất gì chứ nếu mất thì chắc chuyện còn đi xa lắm. Gọi lễ tân và phục vụ bằng điện thoại trong phòng đôi khi không có phản hồi, phải nhắn tin qua mã qr zalo mới được. Mình có chút trải nghiệm 3 ngày 2 đêm như vậy thôi, dịch vụ đa dạng nhưng độ chuyên nghiệp có vẻ chưa bắt kịp vào lúc mình đi. Nếu có cơ hội quay lại, chắc mình vẫn sẽ tới nhưng lần 2 mà trải nghiệm không hơn lần đầu thì chắc chắn không có lần 3."

Khách sạn có xe đưa đón miễn phí theo khung giờ cố định từ khách sạn tới trung tâm phố cổ và ngược lại. Bạn nên đặt trước qua bộ phận lễ tân cho cả chiều đi lẫn về vì có những khung giờ khách đi rất đông, đặt trễ sẽ không có chỗ. Phòng dành cho 2 người rất rộng rãi, có ban công để ngồi xung quanh trồng hoa. Căn hộ 2 phòng ngủ view biển đẹp, ban công rộng. Có bếp và bạn có thể mượn chén bát nếu có nhu cầu. Ăn sáng buffet tại khách sạn tại tầng 1 nhìn chung ổn, món ăn tương đối phong phú. Mình thích nhất là hồ bơi ở đây rất rộng, nước trong, xung quanh bao phủ những hàng dừa và những hàng dâm bụt rất thanh bình. Bạn nên tắm vào sáng sớm nước rất ấm và có thể ngắm bình mình lên trên bãi biển an bàng. Nhìn chung, khách sạn mới khai trương nên giá rất ổn so với những tiện ích mình đã nhận được."

Nhân viên cũng tốt bụng và hữu ích, giải thích tất cả các tiện nghi và quyền lợi mà chúng tôi có trong quá trình nhận phòng. Nhược điểm xa phố cổ hội an, bữa ăn cũng ổn so với giá bạn phải trả. Tốt hơn nên khám phá lựa chọn ăn uống tại trung tâm thành phố hội an/phố cổ để có nhiều lựa chọn, hương vị và giá cả tốt hơn. Mẹo khách sạn này (hoặc khách sạn khác ở khu vực bãi biển an bàng) sẽ tốt nhất để trải nghiệm vào mùa hè (tháng 2-tháng 6). Ở lại trung tâm thành phố hội an tốt hơn vào mùa mưa (tháng 10-tháng 12)."

The facility was clean and impeccable, the breakfast was delicious that featured both local specialties. The biggest selling point of this hotel for me was the staff. All the staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive. My partner loved the complimentary vietnamese classes during our stay. I enjoyed conversations with the staff about local events specifically and about vietnam generally. I appreciated that they allowed me to know hoi an a little better through their own personal experiences. Great job!! the next time i visit hoi an, the saga hotel is where i will stay."

They walked us directly to our room while showing us parts of the hotel like the pool, bar, spa and dining areas. The room was clean and beds were comfortable. The pool area is quaint and not super large so the lounge chairs can fill up very quickly. The room included breakfast buffet which was very good with many options. I wished they had bar service at the pool and hope they can make that change. It s a relatively new hotel. The spa services was also nice. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

Hội An,The Saga Hotel Hoi An,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"8,0",27/08/2025,Stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay. Staff are friendly. Breakfast has lots of options at buffet even for vegetarians. King size bed is massive. Biggest one i ve seen in vietnam. Tv only has youtube not netflix etc. Pool is good sized but a few more sun lounges would be good. Bed is comfortable and free mini bar made kids happy. For the price it s good value. As other review have said you can hear the kids early morning in the pool so if you re a light sleeper ask for room away from the pool. The kids play area is mostly broken and needs refurbishing. Short walk to some good restaurants

We checked in a bit late at night so it was a bit rush, but we got a free room upgrade which was truly great. The room was spacious , and the bed was super big and comfortable. We tried room service too , and the food was great and not really overpriced. Pool was big and clean as well, but need to be fast to grab one of the limited chairs if you want to get some sun. Where the hotel really shines is with the staff. They are very attentive and helpful and gives a really personal touch. They asked about our day every morning and knew our names after day 2 cannot recommend this hotel enough."

They accommodated several room/date changes for us and made special meals to accommodate dietary restrictions. Our family of four felt right at home, and we were never bored with the swimming pool, foosball, and pool table. The location equidistant from the town and the beach is the only inconvenience, but a taxi to either is only about 3 so it s not a big deal."

The hotel itself is beautiful, with well-maintained rooms that are both comfortable and stylish. The thoughtful amenities and attention to detail truly set it apart.

Rien d alarmant mais si des enfants decident de jouer à 6h30 dans la piscine on peut les entendre. La piscine ouvre tot et ferme tôt. C est dommage mais sans doute que c est adapté a la culture locale. Le rapport qualite prix est imbattable.

Our room was quite decent, and we particularly liked the charming, traditional vietnamese decor. The location truly stands out, offering super easy access to the old town, as well as a variety of restaurants, spas, and bars right nearby.

Hội An,The Signature Hoi An,Traveloka,Tony,"10,0",12/10/2024,"We had an amazing stay at the signature hoi an! the hotel was newly renovated and it definitely shows with how clean everything was. The check-in process was a breeze. We had a nice complementary drink while the concierge explained everything about to property to us. They also brought up that their spa is under renovations so to compensate for that, they gave us free massages at another local spa which was also amazing! the suite we had was super large. A king size bed would have better filled out the room but the queen size was just fine. Everything inside the room was squeaky clean and new! most importantly was that the a/c was centrally located and was strong enough to cool down the entire space. Along with the ceiling fan in the middle of the room, i got pretty cold and had to turn it off. The restroom was nicely appointed with stone and quartz top. The tub was a nice touch. The restaurant here is actually pretty good! one of the better hotel restaurants i ve been to and actually just a good restaurant in itself. The free buffet was great with a bunch of different options. The pool looked amazing! it was raining most of the time we were here so we weren t able to enjoy it. Overall a great stay and would definitely come back here next time!"

It is far enough from the busy streets of old town but close enough to walk everywhere. The area around the hotel has plenty of restaurants as well and the night market is a 5 minute walk. We felt the driver who picked us up at the airport in danang drove recklessly and to make up for this, the hotel provided free transport to our next destination.

Hội An,The Signature Hoi An,Traveloka,Patricia,"4,0",18/01/2025,"Dès notre arrivée le 22/12, l accueil a été problématique. La dame qui nous a reçus nous a attribué une chambre avec vue sur une autre chambre, alors que nous avions payé pour une vue sur la ville. Lorsque mon compagnon a signalé cette erreur, elle a été désagréable, affirmant que la vue n était pas garantie et que la chambre correspondante n avait pas d ascenseur. Après insistance, elle a passé la discussion à son collègue. Nous avons finalement obtenu la bonne chambre, mais son attitude a terni notre séjour. Elle a ensuite continué à nous envoyer de nombreux messages via whatsapp pour justifier son erreur, ce que nous avons trouvé intrusif. Cette situation nous a conduits à écourter notre séjour. Prévu pour 5 nuits, nous sommes partis après 2 nuits, organisant un transfert privé pour poursuivre notre voyage. Avant notre départ, nous avons effectué le check-out normalement. Cependant, en cours de route, l hôtel nous a appelés pour signaler un oubli de facturation pour notre transfert à l arrivée et nous demander de payer directement le chauffeur en espèces. Nous avons payé, mais cet épisode résume bien notre séjour."

Phòng ốc khá rộng rãi và sạch sẻ, chú chủ homestay dễ thương cực, rất nhiệt tình dù chú khá là hướng nội nhưng chỉ cần tụi mình ngỏ lời nhờ vả hoặc cần gì chú điều vui vẻ hỗ trợ. Nhìn chung mặc dù phòng vẫn có nhiều thiếu sót như tủ lạnh k cắm điện sẵn (nhưng chỉ cần cắm điện là sử dụng được ngay), chăn gối đôi lúc thiếu nhưng chỉ cần gọi chú một tiếng chú lập tức đem lên liền, home tht sự rất rất tốt luôn í vì chủ home là 1 chú tầm 40-50 tuổi một mình quản lí nên có gì mn cứ liên hệ chú nha, chú sẽ hỗ trợ hết mình á. À với cả lúc mn đặt phòng nhớ để ý cái giờ thuê phòng nữa á cả lỡ đến sớm hoặc sai giờ đôi khi sẽ k có phòng sẵn cho mn đâu í. (đây là feedback tâm huyết nhất của mình vì khi đọc những feedback khác của home mình thấy khá buồn vì trải nghiệm của mình ở home tht sự rất tuyệt, kiểu nó nhẹ nhàng mà dễ thương lắm). Ngoài ra ở home có sẵn tầm 3 chiếc xe đạp nha, cứ hỏi chú chú sẽ cho mình mượn, cần gì hay thắc mắc gì cứ hỏi thẳng chú luôn nha, chú thoải mái lắm! ( còn đây là sđt của chú chủ homestay nha 0947179668 - mn muốn đặt phòng liên hệ thẳng chú luôn cho tiện vì đặt trên app phải thu từ tiền đặt phòng của chú, thành ra thu nhập của chú cũng sẽ ít lại đã vậy còn phải tự trả thêm thuế nữa tội chú lắm, với cả như vậy sẽ chủ động trong giờ nhận phòng hơn nữa á) hy vọng homestay sẽ được nhiều người biết đến hơn nữaaaaa"

Hội An,Tropical Home Villa,Traveloka,Editha,"10,0",16/02/2025,My friends i stayed here last year. We were so satisfied with the place service i decided to book here again this year. It s walking distance to the main town the staff are so accommodating. We booked our activities airport transfers with them. The only thing is the tv channels were mostly vietnamese. No netflix or you tube. But otherwise would come back again.
Hội An,Tropical Home Villa,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",23/02/2025,We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. Distance to the old quarter is walkable. The staff members were kind and helpful and the hotel is clean. The room was okay but a bit damp and musty smelling. Breakfast was also acceptable but not great.
Hội An,Tropical Home Villa,Traveloka,Tara,"10,0",13/05/2025,Tropical home villa is a bit outside the hustle and bustle of hoi an which was greatly appreciated during the stay. There is a small pool on the property.
Hội An,Tropical Home Villa,Traveloka,Maxime,"10,0",05/06/2025,Super nice boutique hotel- the family room was perfect for our two kids (11 and 14) and two adults. Awesome pool. Beautiful surroundings.

Hội An,Tropical Home Villa,Traveloka,Deana,"10,0",25/06/2025,"It was lovely! the pool was great, the breakfast was fabulous and the staff was wonderful. We could kind of hear our neighbors from the bathroom, but only when we were in the bathroom. Otherwise, it was very comfortable."

Great amenities were in the room, including air-conditioning, a nice big countertop to put your stuff, a refrigerator, coffee, and tea station, and rain, shower head plus all the toiletries you need. The breakfast was wonderful with very unique and tasty dishes, and beautiful presentation. It was in a great location as well.

Because it is a homestay, there were limited rooms there is no elevator. Request for a room in the ground floor if you have limited capacity to climb the stairs if your room is in the upper level."

Our only regret is that we didn t stay longer! the location was perfect! the view from our room was magical and cindy and nana, the lovely ladies who operate the front desk, were incredible! they helped us with everything we needed, including laundry and booking all of our tours excursions.

Overall it was a great stay!
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Gayle,"10,0",24/02/2025,"This was my second time staying at truc loc villa and i would stay there again! they have done renovations since i was last there and now have an elevator. The staff are always so friendly and helpful. The rooms are quite big. The location is great. It is not even a 10 minute walk to old town but far enough away from all the tourists. The free bikes are a great way to explore the area, especially an nang beach."

Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Felix,"10,0",29/05/2024,"Thanks for a lovely stay. The hotel is a calm, relaxing small hotel in a nice position overlooking the river with very friendly and attentive staff. Its set back about 5-10 minutes walk from the night market which is busy at night so its nice to be away from all the action. Also nice to sit by the pool and have a dip to cool off. Easy to walk around the island its on and to the main historic sites."
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Sabrina,"10,0",10/05/2024,Our stay at truc loc was wonderful! the room was very clean and quiet. The view from the balcony is beautiful! nana was our hostess and she was very kind and gave us a referral to a tailor and coupon to a nail salon.
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Ashley,"10,0",20/02/2024,"This place was a nice place to stay for two night. The most amazing thing was the hospitality of cindy and her family at check in, she had a handwritten list of about a dozen places for eating, shopping, etc and told us everything we should and shouldn t do in the town and how much to expect to pay for things so we didn t get swindled. It is not the ritz--there were a few bugs in the room, there is some street noise that you can hear from the rooms (which can be a bit loud because of the surrounding markets until maybe 10 or 11, then much quieter), there is no elevator,etc, but it was pretty clean and comfortable and in a very good location. I would recommd datahing here."
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Gayle,"10,0",22/02/2024,"It was in a great location, far enough from all the noise but close enough to walk to shops, restaurants, the night market and the canal to see all the lanterns at night. All the staff were super friendly and helpful. My only complaint is about the pillow - it was a foam block. I could not use it because it gave me a sore neck."
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Jennifer,"10,0",18/02/2024,"Great value! super clean, spacious and staff were very welcoming. Loved the location, easy to walk around and not too close to the noise of the night market. Would definitely stay there again!"

Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Maurice,"10,0",21/02/2024,"Wonderful property with great service. Nahnha was so wonderful to us. She was a gracious and genuine host. Right by the river, with nice balcony views. Close to the night market and ancient village. Both were within a 10 minute walk. Wish we could have stayed longer."
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Kevin,"10,0",20/01/2024,"My wife and i stayed in two different rooms for a total of two special weeks at truc loc villa. Both rooms were clean and comfortable with king size beds,great ac and view balconies. Our hosts, nana and cindy, were two of the kindest and friendliest people we have met in our travels. They gave us stellar restaurant recommendations, arranged airport car service, handled our laundry and much more. Because the villa is perfectly located on the river, just one long block outside the often noisy old city, the nights were quiet for a good sleep, and we could walk everywhere or hop in one of the plentiful, inexpensive taxis. For us, the villa was an excellent choice and we would happily return."
Hội An,Truc Loc Villa,Traveloka,Elvira,"4,0",03/03/2024,The property is very outdated no elevator we received a room upgrade to the 4th floor climbing stairs in 32 degrees is not fun. Ants all over the room. Minimum maintenance even after we asked to clean the room it was dirty. The only good thing i can say is the staff was very friendly nice and helpful sharing information and guidance. They were able to arrange tours and rides transportation from and to the airport.

Bữa sáng miễn phí nhưng rất ngon và đa dạng. -có sách giới thiệu khách sạn và hội an rất chi tiết và hữu dụng cho người lần đầu đến đây. Nhược - quạt trần quay như sắp rớt. Máy lạnh còn rất tốt. - phòng tắm thiếu móc treo đồ. Có chổ treo khăn, nhưng treo phía trên bồn cầu thì chưa hợp lí lắm - tấm gương hơi to đặc đối diện giường ngủ làm cho mình khó ngủ.

Hội An,Victoria Hoi An Beach Resort and Spa,Traveloka,Susan,"8,0",31/08/2025,The victoria is the best u will get at cu dai beach and it s a favourite of ours after 4 stays over the years. However u need to measure expectation with reality ! location is stunning but property is old and needs refurbished! the junior suites are still good but the property just lacks attention to detail ! the reception staff are ok .. Security and pool staff amazing! bar and restaurant staff lack enthusiasm. The manager was present but not really engaging or interested sadly! having stayed in town at la siesta .. Customer service is outstanding.. We were spoiled! as long as we go here expecting a good 3 star u will not be disappointed but it s bu no means the 5 star luxury advertised ! it s still got a soft spot for us and just willing it to become better at the the little details !

Even if it comes with the green tick under amenities on the hotels.com website. They do not. For a.hotel that is over 30 mins from the nearesr airport (and about 15 mins drive from the shopping mall of tourist tat that is downtown hoi an - please don t believe the old town naming that suggests history and culture as it is anything but) this is a major failing. Their attitude was dismissive and rude. Not what you would hope for at the premium rates they charge. The service is poor (eg. Can you come down to collect your room service drinks as we are too busy to bring them to you ... When we had already waited 15 mins and there was no other guests around). The management invisible. The pool over-crowded. The cocktails watered down. The pork spring rolls made from shrimp (as we ran out of pork ... But chose not to tell you). The local tours crazily over priced. The thing with almost every hotel and excursion in vietnam is that they over promise and under deliver. You could say they lie to lure you in. They probably call it marketing. It isn t. It is deception. And the victoria showed absolutely no interest in addressing our concerns or ensuring our satisfaction. There are lots of other hotels in the area.it s your choice but i would not stay in the victoria again."

The hotel is about 3 miles, 5-10 mins outside of hoi an old town but they run a free shuttle several times a day which was very handy. Having said that, the taxi fare is not the much anyway - around 10k vnd 3 the surrounding area has a number of restaurants where you can get cheap vietnamese and western style food and there are a few shops and pharmacies for necessities i would definitely recommend hoi an and the victoria spa resort."

As to be expected the beers are more expensive at the hotel than in town. But paying a little more to lay around the pool was worth it for us. The hotel offered a shuttle in and out of ancient town 3 times a day and even squeezed us on when one night we forgot to book. On check out, the called and taxi and arranged a fixed price that was substantially cheaper than our taxi there and as we left at 5am for a flight, they had arranged a breakfast bag for each of us as we were leaving before breakfast opened.

Hội An,Victoria Hoi An Beach Resort and Spa,Traveloka,Julia,"8,0",13/12/2019,"Die direkte strandlage sowie der pool waren sehr gut. Die liegen wurden nach bedarf aufgestellt. Das personal war überwiegend sehr aufmerksam. Der shuttle service nach hoi an war bequem und pünktlich, jedoch fehlte am frühen nachmittag und späten abend die fahrgelegenheit. Die zimmer wurden jeden tag ordentlich gereinigt. Der aufenthalt am pool wurde gelegentlich mit freien getränken und obst versüßt. Das frühstück war vielfältig und lecker. Es gab sowohl kontinentale als auch einheimische speisen. Es gab jedoch innerhalb von 6 tagen keine abwechslung. Das abendessen war sehr gut. Die preise dafür sind auf dem europäischen niveau. Der shuttle service von/zum flughafen war zuverlässig und sehr bequem, jedoch mehr als doppelt so teuer wie er im ort angeboten wird."

There is an excellent selection at breakfast and the pool is nice, plenty of room to swim. But the best part of this hotel is the team that work there. Everyone gives their all to make sure that you have the best stay. It was my birthday on the stay and the breakfast team sang to me and gave me cake. Each evening the housekeeping team provide a wonderful legend and chocolates for your pillow.

It s not just a five-star experience it s a true 10/10 destination from the moment you arrive. From the reception to the rooms, from the views to the exceptional service, and from the delicious daily breakfast to dinner under the stars every detail is curated to perfection. The staff consistently go above and beyond to ensure you feel genuinely valued and taken care of. As someone who has traveled across north america and europe, i can honestly say that the level of hospitality here is rare. In many places, you often feel like just another guest. At moire hoi an, you feel like royalty. You re not just getting great service, you re experiencing what hospitality should be. Both my wife and i were genuinely thrilled with our stay (april 2025). The resort s atmosphere, warmth, and attention to detail made it one of the most memorable experiences we ve ever had. We re absolutely coming back.

It is right across the bridge from the hustle and bustle of the old town s core, less than a 2 min walk, but once inside it feels like you re in a different world. We had been staying at more boutique properties throughout our vietnam trip and the service was a tad more impersonal than other places we experienced (though still kind and efficient and very friendly) but i think that is something you can expect from a property that is now managed by an international company."

Breakfast was leisurely and with a great selection of fruits, juices, coffee, eggs you name it. A special mention to lee and gwen who take pride in knowing all the great places to eat, drink, get massages, taxis and have a friendly team supporting the exceptional service we were shown. Handy bike loans meant when we felt like it, the busy town centre was a short ride, and even the beach didn t seem too far a cycle. Would recommend this to all and everyone in a heartbeat.

The food / cafe area at the entrance with a breath taking view of the river and garden surroundings hides the great villas inside that includes a pool for those hot summers. Other then the small little problems with the water heaters in the bathrooms that seems to be inconsistent in keeping the temperature, the rooms are comfy and big for both the single and family rooms. The other is that the 2nd floors are only accessible via a single staircase but the porters are always helpful with the luggages and shoppings."

He even cooked a banana pancake for my wife and i after noticing how hungry we were. He didn t ask, didn t need to be cajoled. He just noticed and helped out.

This family run hotel aims to make you feel like a part of their family and they certainly succeeded with us two couples. The rooms are lovely and light and the furnishings delightful. Very comfortable bed with good thick sheets. Very close to hoi an old town, don t be put off by your first impression. It s in a small alleyway that taxi s can t get to, but it s less than a stones throw to a road and vincent and his family are there to take your cases through. When we became familiar with the alleys, they became great shortcuts. Lovely clean swimming pool such a bonus in a budget hotel. Only downside was no lift, so if you re in any way incapacitated, choose the ground or second floor. Intend to stay again."

We stayed in a standard double room to start and it was fine - modern, clean and comfortable. After extending our stay, we moved to a superior room - quite a bit larger with additional windows (brighter) and a terrace overlooking the pool. Worth the small extra price. Breakfast (included) was exceptional - made-to-order eggs or vietnamese dishes, fruit shakes, fresh fruit or pancakes, and, according to my wife the best vietnamese coffee . The pool was great for cooling off after a day walking around town. Free bikes available which we used a number of times to ride out to an bang beach or along the river. The family couldn t be friendlier or more helpful. We also used their taxi service from the airport and were happy with it (a driver waiting at arrivals with a sign). This place is a gem!"

However, once we raised the issue with the manager, tuyet, she stepped in quickly and handled the situation professionally, which we genuinely appreciated. The staff overall were polite and welcoming, and their attentiveness did help to ease the frustration. It s also worth noting that the hotel is quite far from the old town, so be prepared for a bit of travel if that s where you plan to spend most of your time.

Hội An,Vinpearl Resort & Golf Nam Hoi An,Traveloka,David,"6,0",31/10/2024,"The property itself was very good however as we had an executive room that overlooked the beach, the windows outside our living area was always misted up and foggy (it didnt appear to be cleaned or wiped regularly) and as such we could not enjoy the view unless we went outside. Whilst the resort was secluded it also made it hard and costly to go into town with only 2 shuttle buses headed into old town, one at 8 30am and the other late i recall. Also, one of your staff members made my wife feel really uncomfortable by asking her to change her clothes or to cover up on what was really modest clothing at breakfast. She wore long trousers and a top that covered her chest. There were other guests who wore even more revelaing clothes such as bikinis or see through tops and short skirts. We also enjoyed a round of golf at vinpearl golf (having never played before or understanding how it worked) but the staff were very accommodating however at the end, it was very awkward as we tried to tip the caddys more than what we would normally tip at vnd200,000 each but they refused to accept it and we were told it had to be at least double that. I was under the impression in vietnam that tipping is voluntary and not obligatory. Lets a sour taste in our mouths."

The room was very clean, well maintained and we had a view onto the start and the town beyond. Could even e the tower of the buddhist temple which was lit up at night. The hotels breakfast was tasty and a wide variety of western and eaten dishes. The pool was small but clean with plenty of sunbeds available. They had happy hour on cocteau every afternoon, and also a great light lunch deal for 3 of a beer and snack type food. The staff were amazing willing to help with every little question or concern. They offered a laundry service which was cheap.

The only downside is the location, as it is quite far from the center of hoi an. However, they do provide bicycles for free, and it s nearer the tru que fishing villages than most hotels, and the anang beach as well. There is a shuttle to the city center we didn t use, taxis are rather cheap to go to the city. Breakfast could be improved with more cheese (only la vache qui rit available, and that on demand)."

A new hotel, it is very well managed with a staff that goes out of their way to make you comfortable and secure. A pleasant and fresh breakfast is offered each day, with a variety of choices, including an omelet station. The quality of food is good and the service is outstanding. The hotel has a spa, swimming pool and very nice courtyard where you can relax after a busy day in ancient town or the markets. The rooms are very well tended and large by vietnamese standards. Bathrooms include the usual amenities, though i wish they offered bar soap. Shuttles to and from ancient town are offered a couple of times each day, however, i wish they were a little more frequent. Even so, cabs are frequent and very reasonably priced. In general, we would not hesitate to return the golden pearl and would highly recommend it while in hoi an."

Hội An,White Lotus Hotel Hoian,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"8,0",02/07/2019,"The hotel is quite a new hotel and was reasonable for my 5 nights stay there. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable. Basic amenities are provided. Breakfast spread was quite alright, some pastries and cake, bread, cereals, fruits and vietnamese food. The service however, was subpar. Not many of the staff could speak english, and could not understand me through the phone, so i had to come down to reception each time to explain if i needed something. The cleaning was not great, sometimes they didn t even clean the bed unless i was there and asked them directly. The pool was quite nice but as it was outdoor and uncovered it was really hot unless you go in the afternoon. Also, it s very noisy as there s some kind of construction nearby so i wasn t really able to relax. T the massage was not great. It felt like i was beaten up. The location is a bit far from old town, and even further to the beach. They do have free shuttle buses which only goes a couple of times and free bike rental, but taxi is quite cheap (32k dong). I couldn t get any grab car though from the hotel. Overal it s okay but service and standards could be improved."

It was a little walk to get into town which wasn t great on the hot days but the cheap cocktails at the villa helped. Also there was a little bit of noise durning the day with construction next door and a neighbour who liked to play music but it was always quiet in the evenings.

Supergullig familj ägde stället och de gjorde allt för att man skulle trivas . Städning varje dag, cyklar och moppe att hyra , väldigt bra frukost och gångavstånd till stan.

Hội An,Windbell Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Anonymous,"8,0",29/01/2015,"Overall, this was a great hotel. Really nice rooms, friendly staff and good location. Our only criticism is a rather strange one living close to our bedroom window was a rooster. It crowed at various times of the day and night (including from 5am to 7am each morning). Additionally, as others have mentioned, there was some construction work going on in/around the hotel. The rooster-construction combo made it difficult to sleep at times. Other than that, a great find and very good value for money."

Hội An,Windbell Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"10,0",16/10/2014,"We stayed in a standard room and it was quite large, clean and well equipped. The bathroom was also very nice. The wi-fi sometimes doesn t work that well from the bed room but is always ok in the reception/restaurant. The staff is very friendly and they don t try to sell you loads of visits/packages, but if you want to book anything they can do, so that s great. The swimming pool is very nice, especially after a hot day! the breakfast is very nice, you can order as much as you want. The hotel is located on an island south of hoi an, you can walk to old town in 10-15 min. The hotel proposes taxi service to old town for 30,000 vnd (1.5 usd) and to the beach for 80,000 vnd. You can hire a bike for 30,000 vnd per day. The one i had was quite poor though... The hotel can drop you off to the airport for 20 usd a bit more expensive than what you can get from the old town by negotiating but at least they re on time, their car is nice, they know you have paid at reception, they understand where you want to go! we thought it was good value for money as we had a nice deal on hotels.com"

Doch auf dem hotelgelände wird gebaut und ein ende ist meines erachtens noch nicht absehbar.der maschinenlärm zwingt einen tagsüber die ferne zu suchen. Am unerfreulichsten fand ich aber die mangelnde bereitschaft des hotelmanagments nach einer angemessenen lösung zu suchen."
Hội An,Windbell Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Thomas,"2,0",20/12/2014,"We arrived just to be informed (with a sign and without appolgies) that there is construction work. Cant understand why we have not been informed before arrival as we were in contact with this hotel until 1 day before our arrival. This was clearly on purpose, we ve been tired and due to the cancellation policies we had no option. Work is from 07h00-17h00, so forget about a nap, or sleeping a bit longer. Our passports have been borrowed but only returned at checkout. With no explanation, the room was payed and we had no extras...anyway, what gives anybody the right to hold back your passports? anywhere in vietnam the accomodations only took copies and gave the passports back. You dont get much assistance (and to be honest, we where not interested after all this surprises) for your time in hoi an, except to go to the tailor that is somehow connected with this accomodation. Room is really nice and clean. Staff is not that friendly or motivated, except one young lady during breakfast service. On then last day we had a dead mouse on our corridor"

Hội An,Windbell Villa Hoi An,GoogleMap,Arnout,"10,0",02/11/2014,"This is a great home stay option. Cam nam island is quiet but there are some good options for food and some nice places for a beer. At windbell you are away from the noise on the roads and bustle from the tourist area, but in less than 10 mins walk you are at the central old town. The hotel is small with only a few rooms around a nice pool and beautiful gardens. It has a personal feel and is very comfortable if you want to lounge by the pool. Rooms are spacious. Some additional notes - the area is safe. You can walk back to the hotel easily at night without worry. - there is an 11pm lockup - you can still get in after 11 by buzzing and they come and let you in. In practice most of the town except the tourist strip on the next island is all shut down by 10 so you are unlikely to find this much of an issue. - miss hong is a great stop for a beer on the way into town before the bridge. She rents bikes, does laundry, serves beer, offers very cheap taxi services to airport and tourist places, and is an all round star! well worth visiting. - renting bikes and going on your own to cam kim island is my favorite recommendation. The ferry is pretty mad and leaves from just past the market on the tourist bit. No need for a tour guide. Just go and explore cam kim on bikes."

A short walk from the beach in a quite part of hoi an along the sand, i could definitely recommend for a trip with friends, family, or partner. Staff treated every guest with kindness and respect, did not have any issues with staff or amenities available. From the front desk, sanitation crew, lobby staff, dining room staff, pool staff, and even to the manager, we were accomodated with any need.

But hotel did not mention when we booked that they were doing scheduled renovations on roof. Was very loud started at 7am. Had to move rooms but it was still bad. We stayed in for 2 days so noticed were looking for a quiet beach break. Unfortunately, whole area construction zone (was not hotels fault), but would have booked somewhere else if had of known about renos. Staff were lovely, but room cleaning was basic. Floors not swept so sand/ fine dirt would get was getting into beds. Otherwise good."

Hội An,Wyndham Garden Hoi An Cua Dai Beach,GoogleMap,Craig,"8,0",08/09/2025,"We stayed at the wyndham garden in august for 10 nights.the hotel is in a good position in cua dai and there is a beach club across the road that you can get vouchers for from the hotel. The food was excellent, breakfast being typical of the area with local and western options, as well as an egg station. We only ate in the restaurant once but it was a lovely meal. The hotel tries very hard to give its guests things to do in the evenings, we didn t stay in the hotel at night, instead choosing local eateries and going into old town to eat. The hotel is a little more expensive than the local area but not extortionate. However, they always added tax to your bill so just be aware of this. The staff are lovely and try their best to speak to you in english, their understanding of our language can be an issue but google translate is easy to use to get your questions to be understood. They have laundry service but it is charged per item whereas the local area all do laundry service charged by the kg and is much cheaper than the hotel. The rooms are big enough and we asked for more hangers, not much in the way of drawers for storage. The area around the hotel is mainly homes and restaurants. The hotel provides free use of bicycles should you wish to explore a little bit. Overall a lovely hotel in a lovely area."

The staff were super friendly and helpful, breakfast was good, and the room and bathroom were spacious and very nice. Wifi was good and room safe was big enough for a computer. Food and drink prices were reasonable by hotel standards (e.g. About 4 for an aperol poolside). Only limitation was -- the footprint of the hotel is limited so the pool deck is a bit small and has only 14 lounge chairs for 100 rooms. Late morning they might fill up. But the hotel has an arrangement with a beach club across the road, so guests can use beach chairs over there. About a dozen local beachfront seafood restaurants are nearby. A taxi or app car to the hoi an old town is 3-5 each way depending on time of day."

The staff were all very helpful, and the breakfast buffet provided an excellent variety of foods. Our room was advertised as partial ocean view, which was a bit of an exaggeration as our room directly overlooked the garage (and the rooster!) of the house next door, and we could see the ocean only if we stood on tiptoe on our balcony and craned our necks. Another hotel is being built across the street, which will soon block any direct view of the ocean. However, the room itself was very nice, the property was well maintained, and we enjoyed our stay outside the busy old town area. This property was a great value and i would definitely stay here again."

Seems to be a lot of building working going on around the hotel, like the development of a big new hotel virtaully right in front.

The staff were all so attentive, kind, smiley and helpful and really made us feel valued .. They even addressed us by name at check in without us introducing ourselves! hana and lisa-no deserve special mentions for their hospitality.

We had pool/riverview room was scenic. New hotel going up on ocean side so may not have oceanview rooms by good value, safe area."

Hội An,Wyndham Garden Hoi An Cua Dai Beach,Traveloka,Kerryn,"10,0",18/05/2025,"Brilliant staff who treat you like family and do all they can to assist. Pretty basic hotel in general with lap pool and restaurant, not like a resort and probably more for older patrons or people just wanting to unwind. But staff are fantastic and location was quiet and very close to the beach. Also gave free passes to the beach club which was a 1 min walk if you did want to go to a larger pool with swim up bar etc all in all very happy"
Hội An,Wyndham Garden Hoi An Cua Dai Beach,Traveloka,Ana,"8,0",12/05/2025,Its by the beach but its just a little bit far away from the main area. If you want to be isolated and relax by the beach then this is the best hotel for you. They also have a free shuttle to take you to the main area. But there will be a charge if you need it after 4pm so just go by grab. Staffs are very good and helpful too and we were looked after by locu . Its only the breakfast that i wasnt fond of. We stayed 3 nights and the breakfast are pretty much the same everyday not a lot of options. Food are a bit bland too. Thank you to the porters too they made me felt very welcomed when i arrived!
Hội An,Wyndham Garden Hoi An Cua Dai Beach,Traveloka,Tu,"8,0",24/04/2025,We really enjoyed our stay at wyndham.

We are so grateful to the staff for their help. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.
Hội An,Wyndham Garden Hoi An Cua Dai Beach,Traveloka,Tyrone,"10,0",03/05/2025,"As with all of vietnam the staff couldn t do enough for you. Welcoming reception area, easy check in and our luggage taken to our room. Room was ideal, lovely view from the balcony. Only negative for us was a very hard bed. We ate once in the restaurant on our late arrival and then kept the kitchen open for us which was a nice touch. Breakfast had a wide choice but don t expect too much for the english pallet. Eggs cooked to order how you want them, which we did and then had selection from the continental buffet. Hotel arranged taxi for the trips to the main attraction, but otherwise we used the grab taxi app. All in a very nice hotel only 10 mins from the old town."
Hội An,Wyndham Hoi An Royal Beachfront Resort & Villas,Traveloka,alan,"8,0",20/07/2025,Nice and clean property and friendly staff. I would give the resort 5 stars if the stairwell was enclosed and secures. It will be easy to do security checks on the kids who were staying at the separated rooms.
Hội An,Wyndham Hoi An Royal Beachfront Resort & Villas,GoogleMap,Stefan,"8,0",01/08/2025,"Nice rooms and a reasonable standard service for the price, however, in the hotel towers, the noise from the street was a problem, in addition to the unnecessary piano music playing in the hotel hallways, which could be clearly heard in my room from 7am until 10 30pm. The villas are very nice, however. In the busy pool areas, there were not enough sunbeds for all the guests, since some people would reserve a sun lounger with a towel and then disappear for hours. A better system should be implemented."
Hội An,Wyndham Hoi An Royal Beachfront Resort & Villas,Traveloka,Thu,"6,0",15/07/2025,This property is geared towards small children. It s like a disney property. I was disappointed in the villa. All the bedrooms were separate rooms with outdoor entrances separate from the living room. It was just a weird set up. The spa was a huge disappointment. It was next to the kids pool and loud . Not relaxing at all. The beach is the best thing about the resort.

They didn t understand english, which we completely understand, but they also showed no willingness to assist us even with tools like google translate. When we asked for directions to a nearby location, they gave us incorrect information and didn t make any effort to clarify or help further. Unfortunately, their attitude came across as quite rude and indifferent. The food was average at best, with very limited options for vegetarians.

Même dans un vrai 5 étoiles à ho chi minh ou hanoi, nous avions mieux mangé pour mon cher. 2 cocktails, 2 entrées et 2 plats 2 300 000 dongs, un peu abusé et au restaurant de la plage, le soir, il y avait un problème avec chaque table.

But very nice rooms and friendly staff. It s a shame that some guests treat the areas badly, such as clogging toilets in the pool area or not showering before swimming in the pool so that sun cream leaves a film in the pool."
Hội An,Wyndham Hoi An Royal Beachfront Resort & Villas,GoogleMap,Sonia,"6,0",03/06/2025,"After all the raving reviews we had read, we were very much looking forward to our stay and have been very disappointed. First of all we booked in february for a stay in april and asked for rooms next to one another which couldn t be accomodated according to the staff at reception when checking in. Secondly there was a fire downstairs from our building during our first night. No fire alarm. We were lucky my husband heard the noise and woke us up to go downstairs from the 8th floor where we were staying. Stairs were uneven and quite frankly last steps were almost all too high which meant we almost fell each time. In the event of a hotel evacuation, there would most definitely be some injuries due to the stairs. There was around a dozen people only there including the general manager but most guests were still in their rooms oblivious of the fact their lives were potentially at risk. Fire department didn t arrive until about 50 minutes from them being notified. So overall health and safety - absolutely horrid, can t really be worse. Once all settled we refused to go back to the 8th floor and they kindly accomodated us with one of the villas for the rest of our stay. Then there was the staff we took the all inclusive option when we arrived which we had to justify throughout our stay and argue almost every time we ordered. Overall poor experience facilities are otherwise as described but didn t make up for the rest and our experience overall was nothing short of terrible."

Finally we got permission to have our room in main lobby, however, the staff were not communicated, counter staff again asked us to show passport booking confirmation, very annoying. We told the staff we were asked to wait 45mins in another front desk to check our booking, don t waste our time.

Ok, as it was only me in the room so it didn t matter, but if two people were staying together, who didn t shower together, then the hot water would be a little cold for the second person. Secondly, there was no coffee making machine in the room. For an establishment that calls itself five star, two star instant coffee isn t an option.

If you are looking for a unique, luxurious, and beautiful place to stay in hoi an for a reasonable price, this is it! the staff were thoughtful and welcoming and because they were a small team the customer service felt extremely personal. The location is fantastic for accessing the ancient town or the beach but is far enough away to be very peaceful. The rice fields nearby are gorgeous at sunset and i highly recommend riding the free bicycles or very cheap motorbike rental that the hotel provides through them. Also delicious breakfast, great local recommendations, easy airport transfer arrangements, and quality laundry service! couldn t ask for more."

Hội An,ZEN Boutique Villa Hoi An,Traveloka,Evan,"10,0",11/06/2024,Vy and huong were absolutely amazing and delightful. What a beautiful way to get settled by talking to genuinely sweet staff. The property was quaint and cozy and just what we wanted. The pool was beautiful and nice to relax in. Close enough to old town but still quiet and removed so as to easily enjoy our experience. The breakfasts were exceptional. We absolutely intend to stay here again!

Ein ganz grosses lob an die mitarbeiterinnen, die uns tolle tips gegeben haben und immer für uns da waren, wenn wir fragen hatten.

I was able to use their bike for free to roam their area on my own, but they also offer free shuttle buses to nearby areas, such as the market and beach. The food offered at the hotel was incredible and enjoyed every meal i ate. The complimentary breakfast and massage was icing on a cake! besides the amazing services and food, the hotel is located in a great location where you can easily access a number of cultural locations, such as rice fields, wildlife, etc. Next time, i m in vietnam, i ll definitely return to this hotel!!!"
Hội An,Zest Resort & Spa Hoi An,Traveloka,SammiMK,"10,0",05/01/2020,This was an amazing experience and a highlight in our trip. So close to hoi an yet far enough away to be relaxing. An amazing amount of effort and care was taken for our stay and a shuttle bus regularly to hoi an central and local private beach - but you don t need it with the calm of the pool area. Our only regret was that we didn t stay longer. We travelled with 2 kids (7/10) and stayed in a family duplex and will definately be coming back! highly recommend this property to all travellers

We stayed in the cabin on the boat which was really fun and cool - great for couples. The location of the hotel is perfect, far enough from the hustle and bustle of hoi an for some relaxing and quiet time but still close enough to easily go and enjoy the sites of hoi an. All the staff really took care of us, helping us with our tours, plans and transportation. We checked out at 6am for our early morning flight and the staff had prepared a breakfast bag for us and helped us with our luggage even though it was raining really heavily. Would stay here again if we get the chance to come back."

Hội An,Đông Nguyễn Homestay Riverside,Traveloka,Verified traveler,"6,0",24/12/2018,"The place is nice, and so is the family. It s as pictured and the location in the river is fairly convenient and walkable to the center of things. The negatives the street becomes lined with tour buses waiting on their tour groups, which makes walking and driving a bit more of a challenge. They did laundry for us at a reasonable price, but ruined my favorite (not cheap shirt) and obviously tried to scrub out the stains they caused unsuccessfully but didn t even mention it to us. They also claimed to not have seen the 200k we mistakenly left in a pants pocket that was no longer there when we got our clothes back. And finally, i understand it s a homestay and the family is part of the charm, but i could do without being woken up by a crying baby each morning. Overall, the stay was fine, but i wouldn t return in the future."

Hội An,Đông Nguyễn Homestay Riverside,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"10,0",24/11/2017,"Upon entering, you get the warmth and impression of entering someone s home rather than a cold hotel establishment. The receptionist was very nice and informative with ins and outs of the city as well as providing a map of interesting spots. The hotel includes a fantastic view of the river bank where you can easily peer across to the islands in the river or the mainland on either side of the back if you re on a higher floor. The hotel staff went above and beyond the standard hospitality and we were treated like family. They fed us food and dishes which they themselves would eat which added to sense of authenticity for a smaller town in the countryside. The staff also helped coordinate with local businesses to have my purchased merchandise picked up at a more convenient location during a time crunch when pickup at the store was not possible. At the end, they arranged for very affordable transportation around town and to the da nang airport even when not prompted. On an added note, the room includes an sheet of voluntarily activities which include learning vietnamese from the family on sundays! unfortunately due to timing, we were unable to attend any of these activities but fully intend to take full advantage if we come back to this lovely town. Highly recommended based on my experience."

Die altstadt ist aber nicht abgesperrt. Restaurants, geschäfte und hotels gibt es jede menge. Insbesondere abends bis nachts ergießen sich die touristenströme in die stadt. Das hotel bzw.

Hội An,Đại An Phú Villa,Traveloka,Hrishikesh,"8,0",02/10/2018,"We booked the villa based on all round 5 rating and were not disappointed when we stepped into the place. It is tucked away just off the main road feeding in to hoi an, about 300 mtrs from beach. Place is neat and kept clean by hard working staff. They serve breakfast and have nice variety to it. They can order food for you for lunch from nearby outlet (tamarind - where one can actually dine in). Convenience shops are around corner where you get anything you need including a pharmacy. Had a small pool but we never used that. Beach nearby is clean and pleasant in evenings. You can relax on chairs with cold beer. There are plenty of them around. Our only concern was the air-conditioning in both the rooms we had. Aircon unit is set on top of a tall shelf thereby partially blocking the flow. Issue is compounded because the rooms are huge in size. So even without such placement it would not have cooled enough. Given that danang is super hot during aug/sep, you will not get any comfort feeling anytime of the day or night. They supplied a water cooler but even that was not sufficient. At least 2 well placed aircon is the need of the hour if guests were to feel comfortable. Other than that nothing else to complain. Staff was super polite and person manning the desk (and actually all operations) was very helpful all throughout. Will recommend to friends if the aircon situation is improved."
Hội An,Đại An Phú Villa,Traveloka,Daria,"10,0",10/03/2018,"We very much enjoyed our stay at dai an phu villa over the cny break. This is a new (4-5 months old) family run hotel with a homely and friendly vibe about it. Our room was spacious and very clean, everything was new and in neat condition, and the staff were all extremely helpful and amiable. We took advantage of the airport pick-up and drop-off service available (us 18 each way which is a very reasonable rate) and upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner - who happens to be a very humble and nice guy, and we only realised he was the owner of the place when we checked out and got to chat in a bit more detail. The staff were respectful of our privacy and didn t even feel their presence around the house at most times. The hotel serves a great and plentiful breakfast that i d encourage any guest to try. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the coffee and the delicious omelette banh mi. Location is quite private, on a remote alley just next to an bang market and an bang beach (by far our favourite in hoi an). The street was quiet at all times which allowed for a great sleep - ac wasn t too loud, the bed was super comfy, and the sheets smelled nice (we later found out they use organic cleaning products). The beach is a 3-4 min leisurely walk away from the villa and there are minimarts on the way where you can stock up on water, sunscreen etc. Overall, i d say this hotel was fab value for our and we d come back in a heartbeat."

Hội An,Đại An Phú Villa,GoogleMap,Verified traveler,"10,0",30/01/2019,생각보다 객실이 많이 좁지 않아서 좋았어요. 다만 샤워실에 턱이 없어서 잘 못하면 물이 밖으로 나올 수 있어요. 하지만 직원분들이 너무 친절하셔서 불편함 하나 없이 잘 쉴 수 있었습니다. 그리고 무엇보다 조식이 정말 맛있어요! 내가 주문하고 바로 조리해서 나오기 때문에 더더욱 맛있는 것 같습니다. 수영장도 넓고 수영장이 정말 예쁩니다. 호텔에서 도보로 10분 정도 걸으면 안방비치로 갈 수 있어 충분히 산책삼아 갔다 올 만합니다. 다만 호텔 주변에 많은 호텔이 다 붙어있기 때문에 처음 호텔에 찾아갈 때는 약간 헤맬 수 있습니다. 나머지는 정말 다 좋았어요!!
Hội An,Đại An Phú Villa,Traveloka,Erich,"10,0",04/05/2019,"Cet hôtel de taille humaine est un havre de paix. Personnel attentionné, déjeuner sublime et piscine invitante. Nous avons passé 6 nuits de rêve dans une chambre très propre, décorée avec goût et dotée d un petit balcon. Nous avons alterné entre plage et piscine. La plage de an bang est merveilleuse et près de la villa. Prendre note cependant que l accès à la plage n est pas gratuit. En effet afin de profiter d un parasol et d une chaise longue il vous faudra débourser environ 50 000 dong vietnamien pour la journée. Ce n est pas onéreux mais ce n est pas gratuit . Autre note,le personnel de l hôtel vous propose un accès à la mer situé à 400 mètres de la villa. C est somme toute inutile, car plusieurs accès plus près sont disponibles et surtout avec moins de touristes. Cela dit, ça n enlève en rien les 5 étoiles que je donne à cet endroit. Un des meilleurs hôtels de la région."
Hội An,Đại An Phú Villa,Traveloka,Pak Hong,"10,0",18/02/2020,"I rarely post a review but really want to give this wonderful place a mention. We have been to hoi an before and wanted a place away from the old town. From the moment we arrived, ken and his staff did everything to make us feel welcome. The property is in very good condition and very clean. With only 9 rooms, they could provide very personalised service. We were there for 5 nights and we were upgraded to a bigger room after 2 nights when it became available. The balconies of all the rooms look out to a small pool, just big enough for laps and a tranquil street. Breakfasts were just right - you could order as much as you want, both vietnamese and western food off a menu and the fruit platter that came with the order was excellent by itself. We got used to ordering our breakfasts the night before so as to have it well-prepared when we came back the next morning. An bang beach is just 5 minutes away and it is a long stretch of very fine sand which goes on for kilometres with the usual beach deckchairs, kiosks, seafood restaurants and water sports facilities sporadically clustered around some parts of the beach, leaving other parts wonderfully quiet and unspoiled. We really enjoyed walking a couple of hours along it after breakfast! there were many small restaurants around the villa and so finding a place to eat was not difficult. A taxi ride into town is about 15 minutes and not expensive. Ken s wonderful hospitality was the icing on the cake and made our stay really special!"
